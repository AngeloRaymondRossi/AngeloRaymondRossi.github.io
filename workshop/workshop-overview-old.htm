<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Research Computing Systems (RCS) Group and the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Alaska Fairbanks
are pleased to announce two workshops in Computational Chemistry. 
</p>

<h3><center>Workshops are free for all attendees!<br>Please see <a href="#Workshop Registration">Workshop Registration</a>.</center></h3>
<p>
The goals of these workshops are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>to provide a working understanding of theoretical and computational methods of molecules and their reactivity in the gas- and liquid- phases.
<li>to introduce existing software for obtaining observable quantities describing such systems.
<li>to employ High Performance Computing (HPC) with the goal of improving user productivity and minimizing the obstacles typically encountered by
new users of such complex systems.
</ol>

<p>
The workshops will cover various ways that computers can be used to enhance and expand the educational and research experience of students,
post-docs, and faculty. These introductory level workshops will include both lectures and hands-on exercises using the actual machines.

<h2>Tentative Outline</h2>
The workshops will be held on two separate weeks, roughly based on two separate fields of Computational Chemistry and will include
both lectures and hands-on computer laboratory sessions, which are intended to help participants apply the methods and programs beyond these workshops.

<h3>Workshop Content</h3>
<h4>
Week I - July 18-22, 2016: Electronic Structure Calculations
<pre>
Applications: Gaussian, GAMESS, NWChem, ORCA
Lectures:     Wavefunction Theory, Density Functional Theory, Basis Sets, Miscellaneous Topics

</pre>
</h4>
<h4>
Week II -  July 25-29, 2016: Molecular Dynamics Simulations
<pre>
Applications: CHARMM, GROMACS, NAMD
Lectures:     Force Fields, Molecular Dynamics Simulations, Miscellaneous Topics
Exercises:    Chemistry, Biochemistry, Parallel Molecular Dynamics Applications
</pre>
</h4>

<h2>Collaborations are Encouraged</h2>
<p>
Computational chemistry is highly interdisciplinary in nature and its research area broadly spans physics, chemistry, biology, and material sciences.
Along with the rapid advances in computer technology and theoretical algorithms, computational chemistry is widely applied and provides important
microscopic insights into many complex systems. At present, computational chemistry is used in experimental research studies to provide both
qualitative and even quantitative predictions, and has tremendous potential for future development and application in many areas of science.
</p>
<p>
These workshops will focus on close collaboration between experimental groups in several research areas including Chemistry, Biochemistry, and
Physics and Computational Chemists, to provide atomic, molecular, or electronic level insights into a wide range of experimental results, including
molecules in isolation, in complexes, or in condensed phases. This involves selecting important model systems and expanding their scale and
efficiency to provide realistic simulations.
</p>
<p>
Oftentimes, students and faculty tend to be narrowly trained in a single sub-discipline. Collaboration with colleagues from different subfields is the
obvious solution to this problem. These workshops provide an opportunity for participants to network and collaborate with other scientists, and to
deepen their knowledge in many other potentially unexplored subfields of chemistry, biochemistry, and physics.
Ample time will be allotted for participants to pursue individual research projects.
</p>

<h2>Who Should Take These Workshops?</h2>
<p>
These workshops will include both lectures and hands-on exercises involving organic, inorganic, organometallic, and bioinorganic systems on Linux
workstations and a High Performance Linux Cluster.
The concepts and examples presented in these workshops are intended for nonspecialists, particularly experimentalists, as well as for new or potential
users of High Performance Computing who would like to solve important problems in various scientific sub-disciplines.
</p>

<h3>No previous experience with either Linux or the applications is necessary.</h3>

<h2>Laptops</h2>
<p>
Participants should use their laptops to access the Linux cluster and to perform visualization components of the exercises.
