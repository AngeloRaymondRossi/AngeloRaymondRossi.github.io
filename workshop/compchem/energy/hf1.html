In <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Hartree-Fock (HF) theory</FONT> the energy of a system 
is given as a sum of five components:<BR><BR>

E<SUB>HF</SUB> = E<SUB>NN</SUB> + E<SUB>T</SUB> + E<SUB>v</SUB> + E<SUB>coul</SUB> + 
E<SUB>exch</SUB> <BR><BR>

The nuclear-nuclear repulsion  E<SUB>NN</SUB> describes the electrostatic repulsion between
the nuclei and is independent of the electron coordinates. In time-independent HF theory, the
kinetic energy of the nuclei is not, but the kinetic energy of the electrons E<SUB>T</SUB>
is considered. Together with the  nuclear-electron attraction energy  E<SUB>v</SUB> it depends
on the coordinates of one electron. The classical electron-electron Coulomb repulsion energy 
E<SUB>coul</SUB> and the non-classical electron-electron exchange energy E<SUB>exch</SUB>
depend on the coordinates of two electrons. Calculation of these last two terms constitutes
the main effort in HF calculations and is also responsible for the unfavorable formal scaling
of computational effort as the fourth power of basis functions used for the description of
the wavefunction. The particular assumption made in HF theory is that each electron feels 
the other electrons only as an average charge cloud, but not as individual electrons.
<BR><BR>

The molecular electronic wavefunction in HF theory is based on the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
LCAO</FONT> (=linear combination
of atomic orbitals) scheme describing each molecular orbital (holding one electron) as a
linear combination of basis functions (usually located at the nuclear center):<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="hf1_pict1.gif"><BR><BR>

The molecular orbital coefficients describe the contribution of each of the basis functions
to a given molecular orbital. The overall electronic wavefunction of the system is constructed 
as an antisymmetrized product of the molecular orbitals (the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
Slater determinand</FONT>) in
order to fulfill the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
Pauli exclusion principle</FONT>. Since the optimal shape of one molecular
orbital depends on the shape of all the other occupied molecular orbitals, the optimization
of the overall wavefunction is achieved in an iterative manner, varying the molecular
orbital coefficients until no further changes in the overall wavefunction occur. The
direction of the variation of MO coefficients is guided by the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
variational principle</FONT>
stating that an approximate wavefunction yields an energy of the system which is
higher than the energy obtained from the exact wavefunction. In other words: in order 
to arrive at the most favorable wavefunction the MO coefficients must be varied such
that the energy of the system becomes as low as possible.
<BR><BR>

The basic steps performed in HF energy calculations will be illustrated using formaldehyde
in its C<SUB>2v</SUB> structure as example. Please observe that the output obtained from HF 
calculations will vary dramatically depending on whether normal (#) or extendet (#P)
output is specified:<BR><BR>

After reading in the geometry of the system and determining its symmetry properties,
the actual first step of Hartree-Fock calculations consists in choosing a basis set
in which the electronic wavefunction can be expanded. This is done in
link 301 of the program, usually by calling a predefined set of basis
functions from a library. In the current case we are using the standard STO-3G
basis set containing three Gaussian functions (primitives) to describe each Slater-type "atomic" 
orbital. Sufficient basis functions are used to describe the core and valence
orbitals of the system. For formaldehyde there will be one basis function for the
1s orbitals of hydrogen and five basis functions each to describe the 1s2s2p<SUB>x</SUB>2p<SUB>y</SUB>2p<SUB>z</SUB>
orbitals of carbon and oxygen. Overall this amounts to 12 basis functions. As each
of these basis functions is described by three Gaussian type functions,
we have 36 primitive Gaussians for the system.<BR><BR>

A first guess for the wavefunction of the system is made in link 401. While earlier versions of
<I>Gaussian</I> used the semiempirical INDO method to derive a first guess of the wavefunction,
the Harris density functional method is used more recently. The orbital symmetries are printed 
for the occupied and the empty (virtual) orbitals.

The actual Hartree-Fock energy calculation is performed by link 502 in an
iterative manner until self consistency of the wavefunction (self consistent field
(SCF) calculation) is achieved. At 
the beginning of link 502 the convergence criteria (rms and max. density changes) 
are listed together with the default number of iterations (here 64). The most important
information listed for each SCF cycle are the actual energy of the electronic
subsystem (that is, the total energy without the core-core repulsion energy) as
e.g. E= -112.352697484853, and the energy change with respect to the previous
SCF iteration,  e.g. Delta-E=       -0.017123861810. All energies are given in atomic 
units.<BR>
