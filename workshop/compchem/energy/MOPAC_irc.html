Once a transition state has been located and its characteristics have been
verified, the (usually) two minima connected by the transition state have
to be localized. This is done by calculating the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">intrinsic
reaction coordinate (IRC)</FONT> from the transition state in the forward and
reverse direction. IRC calculations are performed in MOPAC using the 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> keyword in combination with other keywords
specifying further details of the calculation. The IRC algorithm in MOPAC differs
from that for the calculation of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">dynamic reaction 
coordinate (DRC)</FONT> in that the kinetic energy of the system is quenched 
at each step, thus lowering the potential as well as the total energy of the system
along the pathway. In <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DRC</FONT> calculations the total
energy of the system (= kinetic + potential) is conserved throughout the calculation.
<BR><BR>

The direction of the IRC calculation (forward or reverse) is indicated through
modification of the IRC keyword itself. Specification of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC=1</FONT>
indicates a forward IRC calculation along the normal coordinate 1 (as given in
the output of a <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">FORCE</FONT> calculation). Calculation of
the reverse path is indicated with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC=-1</FONT>.<BR><BR>

The question of selecting points on the IRC path is determined by the keyword 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">X-PRIORITY=n.nn</FONT>. The values of n.nn are given in 
Angstroms and define the distance between two points on the IRC path. It is also 
possible to select the points according to an energetic criterion with
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">H-PRIORITY=n.nn</FONT>. In this latter case, the parameters 
supplied to MOPAC are in kcal/mol (default: 0.10 kcal/mol).
<BR><BR>

The keyword <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LARGE</FONT> controls output of structural and
energetic data along the IRC path. The most important version of this keyword is
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">LARGE=n</FONT> printing the internal coordinates for each nth
point along the path. Usually it is sufficient to print the structures of only every 
5th or 10th point to the output file.

The following sample input file calculates the forward IRC for the reaction of
BH<SUB>3</SUB> with ethylene. The IRC points are selected according to the distance
criterion 5pm apart. The structure of each of the points is printed to the output file.

As a first step MOPAC calculates the force constant matrix and the normal modes
of the system. According to the X-PIORITY criterion, selected structures are then dumped
to the output file. One sample entry (entry 124) close to the end of the IRC path holds
the following information:<BR><BR>

What is listed as "POTENTIAL ENERGY" is the heat of formation of the current structure
(subsequently printed in internal coordinates). The "ENERGY LOST" is the cumulative
kinetic energy quenched out of the system since initiation of the IRC calculation. The sum
of these two energies should always be constant and equal to the heat of formation of
the starting point of the IRC path (usually the transition state). The variation in
"TOTAL" energy along the IRC path listed as "ERROR" can be taken as a measure of the 
numerical accuracy of the IRC path calculation. The structures dumped to the output file
are referenced through the number given as "REF%". The overall movement relative to the
transition state is numerically described by the "MOVEMENT" variable.

The initial momentum supplied to normal mode 1 in this case is exactly one quantum of
vibrational energy. In cases, in which a larger inital momentum is desirable, this can
be adjusted with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">KINETIC=n</FONT> keyword. Using, for example,
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC=1 KINETIC=1</FONT>, an initial momentum of 1 kcal/mol is
supplied to normal mode 1. This option is particularly helpful on flat potential energy surfaces.
<BR><BR>

The use of symbols such as "%" and "AB*" in these entries allows for an easy extraction 
of data for all structures along the path using the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">grep</FONT>
command (grepping for "%", " %", "AB" etc.).
<BR><BR>

All structures contained in the IRC output file can be animated with <I>MOLDEN</I> by just
reading in the file. The heats of formation for all structures are also collected in the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Geom. conv.</FONT> window.
