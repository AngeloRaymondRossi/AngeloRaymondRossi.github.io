<P>
The optimization of transition state geometries is best performed with the
EF optimization algorithm. The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">TS</FONT> keyword must be
used in this case in order to tell the algorithm to look for a transition instead
of a ground state. The following example uses the hydroboration reaction of
ethylene with BH<SUB>3</SUB> to demonstrate the most important keywords. The 
algorithm used for ts optimization is rather similar to the one used in
<I>Gaussian</I> and also locates the transition state in a local search after
calculation of the Hessian matrix.

In this particular case the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">TS</FONT> keyword is
augmented by <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">RECALC=5</FONT> in order to recalculate the
Hessian matrix every five geometry optimization steps. The accuracy of the
optimization process is defined with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GNORM=0.1</FONT>
setting the average gradient norm convergence criterion to 0.1 (default = 1.0).
In order to increase the accuracy of the energies, an increased SCF convergence
criterion with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCFCRT=0.000001</FONT> is used. This defines
a convergence criterion of 0.000001 kcal/mol between two consecutive SCF iterations
(default = 0.0001 kcal/mol). This particular example optimizes the transition state 
within 25 geometry optimization cycles. The last cycles are described in the output
files as follows:<BR><BR>

     GEOMETRY OPTIMISED USING EIGENVECTOR FOLLOWING (EF).   
     SCF FIELD WAS ACHIEVED

The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">HESSIAN CALCULATED NUMERICALLY</FONT> statement indicates
recalculation of the Hessian after every five optimization cycles. For each cycle, the
gradient norm is given together with the heat of formation of the current structure.
In cycle 25 the gradient norm becomes smaller than the convergence limit of 0.1 and 
the optimization is therefore terminated with the statement <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GEOMETRY 
OPTIMISED USING EIGENVECTOR FOLLOWING (EF)</FONT>. One of the problems that can occur
during transition state optimization is that the Hessian has more than one negative eigenvalue.
The optimization is then terminated with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">WARNING! HESSIAN DOES 
NOT HAVE THE REQUIRED STRUCTURE</FONT> statement and a new starting structure must be found
in order to continue the search. Guessing a good starting structure is therefore an important
condition for successful transition state optimizations.<BR><BR>

Whether or not the optimized transition state structure is a true transition state
must, as usual, be verified through explicit calculation of the second derivative matrix.
The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">FORCE</FONT> keyword is used for this purpose in <I>MOPAC</I>.
The output files of these frequency calculations can be read with <I>MOLDEN</I> in order to
obtain an animated picture of the vibrational modes.<BR><BR>
