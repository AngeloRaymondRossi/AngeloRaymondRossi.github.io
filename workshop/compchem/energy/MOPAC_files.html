<P>
In case the MOPAC calculation has been initiated interactively with an input 
file named <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">input.dat</I></FONT>
the following files will be generated after successful execution:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">input.out</I></FONT><BR>
This is the principal output file containing a maximum of information.
This file can be read with <I>MOLDEN</I>, but only the first structure (input structure)
is displayed. In contrast to <I>Gaussian</I> output files, it is not possible to
visualize the optimized or any of the intermediate structures in geometry 
optimizations.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">input.arc</I></FONT><BR>
The archive file contains a short summary of calculational results together
with the optimized geometry of the system. This file can be read directly
with <I>MOLDEN</I>.<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">input.log</I></FONT><BR>
The log file contains one line for each step of the geometry optimization
and all the information also contained in the archive file. This file can 
be read directly with <I>MOLDEN</I>.<BR><BR>
