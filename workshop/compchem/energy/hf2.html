<H2>Convergence in Hartree-Fock Calculations</H2> 
</CENTER>
<HR>
The convergence of Hartree-Fock SCF calculations depends on a series of
options. All of these have sensible defaults which lead to usually
well behaved SCF calculations. The most obvious parameter is the number
of SCF cycles which can be set with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=(MaxCycle=N)</FONT><BR><BR>

the default being N=64. This default is sufficient for most systems, but
significantly higher numbers are required for systems with closely spaced
orbitals such as some transition metal complexes. The
convergence criterion for rms deviations in electron density matrix elements
of the SCF algorithm can be set directly by<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=(Conver=n)</FONT><BR><BR>

the default for n being 8 for geometry optimization and frequency jobs and
n=4 for single point calculations. The latter default is rarely appropriate
and should be adjusted to the same value as for geometry optimizations. Using
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=tight</FONT> is synonymous with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=(Conver=8)</FONT>
and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=SinglePoint</FONT> is synonymous with 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=(Conver=4)</FONT>. The following table illustrates
how much the number of SCF cycles varies with the SCF convergence criterion
for the HF/STO-3G calculation on formaldehyde :<BR><BR>

One can clearly see that the total energy of the system is converged to within 10<SUP>-9</SUP>
Hartree already with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=(Conver=5)</FONT> and that each increase in the
convergence criterion is accompanied by an increase in the number of SCF cycles. For larger and
for less well behaved systems the consequences of changing the convergence criterion are usually
much more pronounced. Calculations on large systems can be accelerated substantially by lowering
various cutoffs and convergence parameters using <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=sleazy</FONT>. This is 
particularly helpful in geometry optimizations when still far away from the minimum.
<BR><BR>

The initial guess used to start the SCF calculation is of great importance for both the 
efficiency as well as the final result obtained in the SCF calculation. The latter point is
of particular importance in symmetric species in which the symmetry of the initial guess decides
over the symmetry of the converged SCF wavefunction. Whether the symmetry of the initial guess 
is retained during SCF cycles depends on the version of <I>Gaussian</I> in use. Newer versions
do NOT retain the symmetry of the initial guess unless <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=Symm</FONT> is
specified. Using the NH<SUB>2</SUB> radical as an example, we will see how either the <SUP>2</SUP>A<SUB>1</SUB>
or the  <SUP>2</SUP>B<SUB>1</SUB> states can be obtained at the ROHF/STO-3G level of theory
depending on the initial guess being used. Starting the SCF calculation with the default (Harris)

The Harris functional guess predicts a highest (singly) occupied orbital of "(B1)" symmetry leading to
a doublet <SUP>2</SUP>B<SUB>1</SUB> state in the converged wavefunction. The SCF algorithm retains
the number of occupied orbitals in each irreducible representation (3*A1, 1*B2, 1*B1). 
The first unoccupied 
molecular orbital (LUMO) is of A1 symmetry. Interchange of the SOMO and LUMO will in this
case lead to occupation of orbitals of different symmetry and thus to a different electronic state.
Adjustment of the initial guess orbitals can be achieved with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">guess=alter</FONT>
keyword and definition of the list of orbital exchanges after the geometry definition. In
the following input orbitals 5 and 6 of the initial guess will be interchanged.<BR><BR>

After performing the default Harris functional guess all orbital changes are listed (here only 5 and 6
are interchanged). This leads to an initial guess wavefunction with a SOMO of A1 symmetry.
The relative order of orbital symmetries is retained during the SCF optimization and the
final wavefunction therefore describes an <SUP>2</SUP>A<SUB>1</SUB> state. This wavefunction
is stored in the checkpoint file on completion of the calculation and can be read from there 
as the initial guess for yet another calculation with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">guess=read</FONT>.
The following input file reads, for example the geometry as well as the wavefunction obtained
in the previous calculation from the checkpoint file (here named /scr1/testit.chk) and calculates the
ROHF/STO-3G energy within a single SCF cycle. Since the wavefunction stored in the checkpoint
file is of <SUP>2</SUP>A<SUB>1</SUB> symmetry, the SCF will converge to the <SUP>2</SUP>A<SUB>1</SUB>
state without any orbital interchanges.

Comparison of the two states optimized here shows that the <SUP>2</SUP>B<SUB>1</SUB> state based on the 
default Harris functional guess is energetically more favorable at -54.8368134090 au than the <SUP>2</SUP>A<SUB>1</SUB> 
state at -54.3257900934 au. Thus, the default guess arrives at the electronically more
favorable state. This is, however, not always the case.<BR><BR>

Selection and manipulation of the initial guess for UHF wavefunctions is only slightly more 
challenging than that for the ROHF case. The added difficulty consists in deciding whether
alpha or beta orbitals should be interchanged in order to arrive at the desired electronic state. 
For the current case of the NH<SUB>2</SUB> radical, use of the default Harris functional 
guess yields again the energetically more favourable <SUP>2</SUP>B<SUB>1</SUB> state at 
-54.8392961557 au. Please note the ROHF/UHF energy lowering of only -0.0025au (-6.5 kJ/mol) 
in this case, suggesting that the wavefunction is well described already in the ROHF picture.

Comparison of the occupied alpha and beta spin orbitals shows that the additional alpha electron
is located in an orbital of B1 symmetry. The complementary beta spin orbital is not occupied. 
Excitation of the electron in the highest lying beta orbital (A1 symmetry) to the next higher 
beta orbital (of B1 symmetry) changes the situation such that in both the alpha and beta orbitals 
there is one B1 and one B2 occupied orbital while the number of alpha orbitals with A1 symmetry 
exceeds that of the beta orbitals by one:<BR><BR>

Please observe that the difference between the ROHF/STO-3G (at -54.3257900934 au) and
the UHF/STO-3G (at -54.7318269247 au) energies of the <SUP>2</SUP>A<SUB>1</SUB> state is much
larger at 1066 kJ/mol than found for the <SUP>2</SUP>B<SUB>1</SUB> state at the same 
theoretical levels.<BR><BR>

There are two different SCF algorithms available in <I>Gaussian</I>. The default
algorithm <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">DIIS</FONT> is quite fast and works well for most 
systems. For problematic cases the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">quadratically convergent</FONT> 
(QC) algorithm is much more reliable but also much slower than DIIS. The latter option is
used with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SCF=QC</FONT> keyword and becomes quite usefull
in the case of convergence problems with the default DIIS algorithm.<BR><BR>

In the case of severe convergence problems, a few further strategies exist to approach the
problem. As a first point it is important to check the geometry of the system under
investigation. Errors in the Z-Matrix definition, which position atomic centers too 
close together, often result in convergence problems during SCF calculations.
Also, it is often found that self consistency is achieved with one method, but not another. 
It is therefore quite helpful to calculate a wavefunction first with one method
and then use the converged wavefunction as the initial guess for another calculation. It
is, for example frequently found that Hartree-Fock calculations converge more readily
than DFT calculations and initial calculation of the HF wavefunction can therefore aid
in getting the DFT calculation started. Ultimately, the convergence behaviour also 
improves with reduced electron numbers. If, for example, calculations for neutral
radicals do not converge, a converged wavefunction can often be obtained for the
corresponding cationic systems (lacking one electron). The cation wavefunction can then
be used as the initial guess of the radical system. If still no convergence can be achieved:
go look for another project!<BR><BR>
