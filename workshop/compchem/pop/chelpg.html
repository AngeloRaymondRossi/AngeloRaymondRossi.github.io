Comp. Chem.</I> <B>1990</B>, <I>11</I>, 361),atomic charges are fitted to reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) at a number of pointsaround the molecule. As a first step of the fitting procedure, the MEP is calculated at a number ofgridpoints spaced 3.0 pm apart and distributed regularly in a cube. The dimensions of the cube are chosensuch that the molecule is located at the center of the cube, adding 28.0 pm headspace between the molecule and the end of the box in all three dimensions. All points falling inside the van-der-Waals radius of the molecule are discarded from the fitting procedure. The following figure describes the situation for wateras a simple example:<BR><BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="chelpg_1b.GIF"><BR></CENTER><BR><BR>After evaluating the MEP at all valid grid points, atomic charges are derived that reproduce the MEP in the mostoptimum way. The only additional constraint in the fitting procedure is that the sum of all atomic charges equalsthat of the overall charge of the system.

Moreover, the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>CHELPG</B></FONT> charges are practically constant at either the Hartree-Fock or Becke3LYP level of theory provided that one of the correlation consistent basis sets is being used. Poor results are obtained even with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>CHELPG</B></FONT> scheme with small basis sets such as STO-3G or 3-21G.<BR><BR>One of the weak points of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><B>CHELPG</B></FONT> (and other approaches based on fitting the MEP) is the treatment of largersystems, in which some of the innermost atoms are located far away from the points at which the MEP is evaluated.In such a situation, variations of the innermost atomic charges will not lead to significant changes of theMEP potential outside of the molecule and fitting of these atomic charges will therefore not result inmeaningful results. It should also be remembered that atomic charges can depend strongly on the conformationof the molecule. Representative atomic charges for flexible molecules should therefore be derived as averagevalues over several conformers. Using ethanol as an example, the charge parameters derived for the C<SUB>s</SUB> symmetric conformer <B>A</B> and the C<SUB>1</SUB> symmetric conformer <B>B</B> vary, in part,by almost 30%. The variation is, however, rather different for different parts of the system.<BR><BR><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><A HREF="eth1.html"><IMG SRC="eth1.gif"></A></TD><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD><A HREF="eth2.html"><IMG SRC="eth2.gif"></A></TD></TABLE></CENTER><BR>A detailed overview of the effects of the basis set and the Hamiltonian on the charge distribution in water can be found in: F.
