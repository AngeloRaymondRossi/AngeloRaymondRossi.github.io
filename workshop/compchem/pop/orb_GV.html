In the case that cube files for selected orbitals have already been generatedfor use with other visualization programs, these can also be read with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GaussView</FONT> using the "Open . . " option from the "File" menu. In the popup window giving you an overview of available files, first select"Cube Files" as file type and then select one of the available cube files throughmouse click. The contents of the cube file will first appear in a new window in ball-and-stickrepresentation. In order to view the actual MO, select "Surfaces . ." from the "Results"menu. This generates a new window for controlling cube files and surfaces. After the"Cubes Available:" heading you find a scroll list containing all currently loaded/availablecubes. This list currently contains only one entry. In order to generate a new surface based onthe currently selected cube file, first choose a cutoff isodensity value (0.004 may be appropriatefor total SCF densities, values between 0.01 and 0.1 may be appropriate for single orbitals),then select "New Surface" from the "Surfaces Actions ..." menu. This will add a new entry in thelist of available surfaces and (after a while) show the surface on top of the ball-and-stickmodel.<BR><BR>The second approach reads all wavefunction information from the binary checkpoint file(*.chk) or the formatted (textual) checkpoint file (*.fch). The latter can be obtainedon addition of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">formcheck</FONT> keyword during a wavefunctioncalculation with <I>Gaussian</I>. The calculation of molecular orbitals for propenehas been chosen here as an example:<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=0><TR><TD><FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><PRE>#P Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) scf=tight formcheckBecke3LYP/6-31G(d) propene orbitals with formcheck0 1C1C2  1  r2C3  2  r3  1  a3H4  2  r4  3  a4  1  180.0H5  3  r5  2  a5  1  0.0H6  3  r6  2  a6  1  180.0H7  1  r7  2  a7  4  180.0H8  1  r8  2  a8  7  d8H9  1  r8  2  a8  7  -d8r2=1.50202789r3=1.33329189r4=1.09120355r5=1.08850227r6=1.0867543r7=1.09519909r8=1.09844079a3=125.26675669a4=118.85584399a5=121.66815687a6=121.82450969a7=111.53888081a8=111.17619079d8=120.72760178</PRE></FONT><TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD><IMG SRC="prop1.gif"></TD></TABLE><BR><BR>This run will, among others, generate a checkpoint file in ASCII text formatnamed "Test.FChk", either in the users home or current working directory.It is certainly useful to move the file to a new name after job completion,which is more reflective of the actual system. Since <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GaussView</FONT>expects formatted checkpoint files to use the ".fch" ending, a name such as "propene.fch"may be appropriate. In order to read this file with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GaussView</FONT>,select "Open . ." from the "File" menu, select "Gaussian Formatted Checkpoint Files" asthe file type, and then select the corresponding file through mouse click. This will opena new window with a ball-and-stick representation of the system. Selecting "Surfaces . ." fromthe "Results" menu generates a new window for the control of cube files and surfaces.In order to generate pictorial representations of the molecular orbitals, one first hasto generate one cube file for each molecular orbital. This is achieved through the appropriateselection in the "Cube Actions ..." menu. One very usefull option is the manual definitionof the range of orbitals to be considered. Selecting the option "New Cube" and defining therange of orbitals as "9-16" will, for the case of propene, generate cube files for thehighest four occupied and the lowest four unoccupied orbitals.<BR><BR>After generation of the cube files, each of them can be used to generate a 3D representationof one molecular orbital after selecting an isodensity cutoff value and then choosing the"NewSurface" option from the "Surface Action ..." menu. In order to compare a series ofmolecular orbitals, it is helpful to activate the "New views for new surfaces" button. This willopen one new window for each new molecular orbital generated from the cube files.<BR><BR>One particularly useful feature of this approach to viewing the 3D structure of molecular orbitalsis that the appearance of the active window can be altered in great detail with the "Display Format ..."option of the "View" menu. In larger systems it is, for example, much more useful touse translucent or mesh representation of the orbitals, which still leave the ball-and-stickmodel of the system as recognizable background. The "solid" representation type is,of course, most impressive.<BR><BR><IMG SRC="prop_mo12s3.jpg"><IMG SRC="prop_mo12m3.jpg"><IMG SRC="prop_mo12t3.jpg"><BR><BR>A third approach towards orbital visualization uses the "MOs ..." option of the "Edit" menuin <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GaussView</FONT>. This approach is illustrated in great detail in a <A HREF="http://educ.gaussian.com/visual/index.htm">short text</A> on the <I>Gaussian</I> home page.<BR><BR>Finally, one should always first write down the number of electrons and molecularorbitals as well as the symmetry properties of the system <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">BEFORE</FONT>starting with the visualization of selected molecular orbitals. What do you expect forpropene at the Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory?<BR><BR><HR><PRE><TT>last changes: 10.01.2007, HZquestions & comments to: <A HREF="mailto:zipse@cup.uni-muenchen.de">zipse@cup.uni-muenchen.de</A></TT></PRE> </BODY></HTML>
