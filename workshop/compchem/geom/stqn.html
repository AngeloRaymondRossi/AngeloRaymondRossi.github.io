<CENTER><H2>Global Transition State Search - <BR> 
The Transit-Guided Quasi-Newton (STQN) Methods</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<P>
In many cases it is difficult to guess a good starting point for the local
gradient-based transition state optimizer while the simple scanning approach
doesn't work (e.g. due to the complex reaction mechanism). For these cases <I>Gaussian</I>
offers two variants of the transit-guided quasi-Newton (STQN) method which first
interpolate between reactant and product structures in a non-linear way and then
initiate a local transition state optimization from the point closest to the
approximate transition state structure. The two variants available in <I>Gaussian</I>
are used with the keywords:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><PRE>opt=QST2</PRE></FONT> or <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><PRE>opt=QST3</PRE></FONT><BR><BR>

The first version <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QST2</FONT> only requires the
reactant and product structures as input, while the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QST3</FONT>
version needs structures for the reactant, the product, and an approximate transition state
(in that order). In both cases the reactant and product structures must be described with
all atoms in the same order. Regardless of the actual coordinates used in the input file,
the actual interpolation and transition state searches will be performed in redundant internal
coordinates. Using the isomerization from HCN to CNH again as an example,
the  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QST2</FONT> input file would be:<BR><BR>

Please observe that a full geometry specification with comment line and charge and multiplicity
must be provided for each of the structures. 
In this particular case the QST2 method fails due to the very unfavorable choice of redundant
internal coordinates made by <I>Gaussian</I>. Instead of moving the hydrogen atom <B>around</B> 
the C-N moiety, the QST2 coordinates try to move the hydrogen atom <B>through</B> the two
central atoms. This will, of course, never lead to a meaningfull starting point for the
transition state search. The QST3 method is more successful in this instance, the input file
being:<BR><BR>

The third structure in the input file corresponds to what has been used as the starting
point for the ts optimization before. The transition state is located in this case within 
9 optimization cycles. In contrast to transition state optimizations using the local 
methods discussed before, a full calculation of the Hessian is not required in 
this case.
