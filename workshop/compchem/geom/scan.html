<P>
Transition states can be localized in many cases through scanning one structural
degree of freedom. This will, of course, only be successful if the reaction pathway can 
be described by essentially ONE structural parameter. In order to cover the
relevant part of a potential energy surface, a series of calculations must be performed
in which one of the structural parameters is fixed to a certain value, while all 
other parameters are optimized to their most favorable values. This 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">relaxed potential energy surface scan</FONT> can be performed automatically
in either a Z-Matrix or redundant internal coordinate system. Both options will be
illustrated using the rotational transition state in hydrogen peroxide (H-O-O-H) as
an example:<BR><BR>

In this particular case the energetically most favorable structure is the one
at 120.0 degrees with an energy of -150.76477 Hartree. The structure at
180.0 degrees is only slightly less favorable at -150.76328 (+3.9 kJ/mol), while
the structure at 0.0 degrees is substantially less favorable at -150.75020 Hartree (+38.3 kJ/mol).
Given the symmetry of the molecule, the structures at 0.0 and 180.0 degrees are therefore transition
states with respect to rotation around the central O-O bond. The following
figure gives an overview over this part of the potential energy surface:<BR><BR>

performing a series of constrained optimizations with different values for dihedral 
angle 1/2/3/4. A complete relaxed rotational potential can be calculated in redundant internals

According to the energies listed in this summary the transition state for this rearrangement is
located at a bond angle of around 80.0 degrees. In order to pin down the location of the transition
state more precisely, a second scan should be performed in which the bond angle a3 is varied between 
90.0 and 70.0 degrees in smaller step sizes (such as 2.0 degrees). In this way one can locate
the transition state to +/- 2.0 degrees. A more precise localization of the transition state structure
must, however, rely on a gradient optimization algorithm.<BR><BR> 

<B>4) Driving a Bond Distance to Study Hydrogen Exchange Reactions</B><BR>
Driving a bond distance is one possibility to study reactions in which bonds are
broken. The bonds chosen for stepwise variation are obviously those that participate
in the bond breaking and making processes. As there is usually more than one bond 
that breaks during a reaction, selecting the one that is most descriptive of the
reaction coordinate is not always straight forward. The example chosen here to illustrate
the situation is the identity reaction of hydrogen radical H with 
molecular hydrogen H<SUB>2</SUB>. Using an internal coordinate system and restricting the
overall system to be linear (for the relevant part of the PES this is not much of
a simplification) there are only two geometrical variables r<sub>3</sub> and  
r<sub>4</sub> left decribing the distances between the central hydrogen atom and 
the two outer hydrogen atoms:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="h3a.gif"><BR><BR>

Optimization of both distance variables at the HF/6-31G(d) level of theory leads to 
localization of a ground state
reactant complex <B>GS(R)</B> with r<sub>3</sub>=72.9971 pm and r<sub>4</sub>=349.1454 pm.
From this stationary point an attempt can be made to find the transition state for the
exchange reaction through either stretching the short bond described by r<sub>3</sub>
or by shrinking the long bond described by r<sub>4</sub> to shorter distances. While 
one could imagine these two options to be more or less equivalent in
an identity reaction, we will see in the following that this is not so.<BR><BR>

Choosing r<sub>3</sub> as our scanning variable and selecting larger and
larger values for this variable starting from the optimized value of r<sub>3</sub>=72.991 pm
corresponds to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">pushing</FONT> the covalent bond between
H<SUB>1</SUB> and H<SUB>3</SUB> apart. An input file for scanning this variable
to r<sub>3</sub>=272.991 pm in 20 steps can be found <A HREF="h3inp.html">here</A>.

The result of this effort is presented in the upper part of following figure. It 
can clearly be seen that elongation of the bond connecting H<SUB>1</SUB> and 
H<SUB>3</SUB> leads to a continous increase in energy. The magnitude of the
energy increase is far larger than expected for a radical substitution reaction
and reaches values at r<sub>3</sub>=270 pm that are far greater than those for typical 
bond cleavage processes (here > 700 kJ/mol). Even though this simple system poses
quite some problems for a number of theoretical methods (for an overview see 
E. Proyonv, H. Chermette, D. R. Salahub, <I>J. Chem. Phys.</I> <B>2000</B>, <I>113</I>, 10013),
energies exceeding the experimentally measured reaction barrier of 40.6 kJ/mol (300K)
by more than a factor of two may indicate that we are not heading for the transition 
state region in this type of scan.<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="h3b.gif"><BR><BR>

Choosing r<sub>4</sub> as the scanning variable and selecting smaller and
smaller values for this variable starting from the optimized value of r<sub>3</sub>=349.1454 pm
corresponds to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">pulling</FONT> the covalent bond between
H<SUB>1</SUB> and H<SUB>4</SUB> together. An input file for scanning this variable
to r<sub>4</sub>=79.1454 pm in 27 steps can be found <A HREF="h3inpb.html">here</A>.
The result of this scan is featured in the lower part of the figure above. Aproaching
from larger distances the energy now rises much more slowly until reaching a maximum
at about 100 pm and just over 70 kJ/mol. Further contraction of r<sub>4</sub> leads to
a sudden decrease in energy suggesting a discontinous or at least very irregularly
shaped potential energy surface. Despite the fact that the energies are much more
reasonable in this second scan, it is not clear whether the energy maximum now corresponds
to a true transition state.<BR><BR>

How can the results obtained in both scans be rationalized?
Plotting the bond distances r<sub>3</sub> and r<sub>4</sub> against each other
gives a better view of the relevant part of the potential energy surface. The following
figure represents a birds eye view of the PES and also contains the true transition
state for the hydrogen exchange reaction at r<sub>3</sub> = r<sub>4</sub> = 93.4598 pm
and an energy of +75 kJ/mol relative to the reactant complex.<BR><BR>

We can now see that pulling in r<sub>4</sub> is a well chosen scanning coordinate
directly aiming at the transition state in terms of its structure as well as its
energy, and that it is only after passing beyond the transition state region that 
r<sub>4</sub> is not a good description of the reaction pathway anymore. Pushing
apart r<sub>3</sub>, on the other hand, represents the wrong direction right from
the start and effectively ruptures the existing H-H bond without forming a new one.<BR><BR>
