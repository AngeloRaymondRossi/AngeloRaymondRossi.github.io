In order to verify the nature of a transition state that has been optimized with one of the local
methods described before, the Hessian needs to display the required number of negative eigenvalues.
Aside from this <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">local</FONT> criterion, it is also necessary to identify the
minima connected through the transition state. This latter part is usually performed through
calculation of some kind of reaction coordinate. One particular choice is the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)</FONT>, defined as the minimum 
energy reaction pathway (MERP) in mass-weighted cartesian coordinates between the transition 
state of a reaction and its reactants and 
products. It can be thought of as the path that the molecule takes moving down the product
and reactant valleys with zero kinetic energy. The Gonzalez-Schlegel method for following the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> can be used in <I>Gaussian</I> using the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc</FONT>
keyword.<BR><BR>

The "recipe" for following the IRC involves walking down the IRC<BR>
in a number of steps with fixed step size <B>n</B>, each of them constructed<BR> 
in the following way:<BR><BR>

(1) Starting from point P<SUB>1</SUB> on the path (shown in blue) construct<BR>
auxiliary point P' located a distance of <B>n</B>/2 away from P<SUB>1</SUB> along<BR> 
tangent <B>a</B> (shown in green). The construction of P' does not involve<BR>
any energy or gradient calculations.<BR><BR>

(2) On a (hyper)sphere of radius <B>n</B>/2 centered at P' search for the<BR>
point of lowest energy P<SUB>2</SUB>. This latter point is the new point on the<BR>
IRC path. This constrained search requires several energy and<BR> 
gradient calculations and obeys the convergence criteria set with<BR>
iop(1/7=x).<BR><BR>

(3)This sequence is repeated until the geometry convergence criteria<BR> 
are fulfilled in direction along the pathway.<BR><BR>

The size of the IRC steps <B>n</B> is given in mass-weighted cartesian coordinates and can be set with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=(stepsize=n)</FONT><BR><BR>

in units of 0.01 amu<SUP>-0.5</SUP>Bohr, the default setting being n=10. If the step size is chosen too
large, the constrained optimizations on the hypersphere will be difficult to converge, while a very small
step size leads to a large number of IRC steps. The default step size is appropriate for many cases. 
A smaller step size such as n=3 is needed for systems with strongly curved IRC paths. For very flat 
potential energy surfaces the step size must be chosen such that the first steps away from the transition
state reach a point at which the gradient has become large enough for the IRC to continue.<BR><BR>

The structure of the transition state can either be given directly in the
input file or (more often) be read from the checkpoint file of the previous transition state
optimization using the <BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">geom=check</FONT><BR><BR>

keyword. In order to follow the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> down from the transition
state to the products, the second derivative matrix (Hessian) needs also to be known at the
starting point. This information can either be retrieved from the checkpoint file (in case
it has been calculated before) with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=(rcfc)</FONT><BR><BR>

or it can be calculated at the beginning of the  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> path with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=(calcfc)</FONT><BR><BR>

The number of steps per job can be determined with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=(maxpoints=N)</FONT><BR><BR>

with N being a positive integer. The default in this case is N=10, much larger values being impractical
due to large file sizes and long runtimes. For each step on the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> path, the
algorithm performs a constrained optimization on a hypersphere, the radius of which is set to half the step size. 
The convergence criteria for these steps as well as those for
final convergence of the  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> itself can be set in the usual way with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">iop(1/7=n)</FONT><BR><BR>

A meaningful choice for n is 300 (as in normal geometry optimization calculations), smaller values being 
useful for flat potential energy surfaces.
A tighter convergence criterion is also needed if small step sizes are used. Please observe that a tight
convergence criterion can be specified either through <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">iop(1/7=10)</FONT> or through
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=(tight)</FONT>. The latter option is, however, not properly operating in some
versions of <I>Gaussian</I>. Similarly, if left unspecified, the default geometry convergence criterion
for IRC calculations in some versions of <I>Gaussian</I> is set to <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">iop(1/7=3000)</FONT>.
As this is rarely useful, it is important to always specify a convergence criterion explicitly in IRC 
calculations.<BR><BR>

The direction of the  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> path can be chosen with either<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=forward</FONT> or <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=reverse</FONT><BR><BR>

the forward direction corresponding to the direction of the transition vector with the largest
component being positive. In practice it is often required to follow the  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> in
both directions anyway and two separate calculations are used, one in the forward and one in the reverse
direction.  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> calculations that have exhausted their maximum number of
steps can be restarted with <BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=(restart,maxpoints=n)</FONT><BR><BR>

with a larger number of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">maxpoints</FONT> as before.<BR><BR>

How these options can be put to work and what kind of errors are typically encountered will 
be demonstrated for the Huisgen reaction (dipolar cycloaddition reaction) of acetylene with 
hydrazoic acid as a <A HREF="irc5.html">worked example</A>.<BR><BR>
