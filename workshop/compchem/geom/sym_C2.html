<P>
This point group contains only two symmetry operations:<BR><BR>

<B>E</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the identity operation<BR>
<B>C<sub>2</sub></B>&nbsp;&nbsp; a twofold symmetry axis<BR><BR>

A simple example for a C<sub>2</sub> symmetric molecule is hydrogen peroxide
(H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), here in its HF/6-31G(d) optimized structure:<BR>

The symmetry of the system is reflected in the Z-Matrix
containing two dummy atoms x1 and x2 located on the principal
symmetry axis. Use of the symmetry properties speeds up energy
calculations, reduces the number of independent structural variables 
from 6 (for an asymmetric, non-linear molecule containing four 
centers) to 4 and thus accelerates geometry optimizations.<BR><BR>

Molecular orbitals as well as harmonic vibrations (if calculated) 
are labeled according to their symmetry properties as belonging to
one of the two irreducible representations (<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A</FONT> 
and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">B</FONT>) of the C<sub>2</sub>
point group. Those properties belonging to irreducible representation
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A</FONT> are symmetric to both the identity 
operation <B>E</B> as well as the 180 degree rotation around the C<sub>2</sub> 
axis. Those properties belonging to irreducible representation 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">B</FONT> are symmetric with respect to 
the identity operation <B>E</B>, but antisymmetric with respect to rotation 
around the C<sub>2</sub> axis.
