<TR><TD>A<TD>symmetric with respect to rotation around the principal rotational axis (one dimensional representations)
<TR><TD>B<TD>anti-symmetric with respect to rotation around the principal rotational axis (one dimensional representations)
<TR><TD>E<TD>degenerate (German: entartet; two dimensional representations, e.g. in systems with higher order principal axes)

<TR><TD>subscript 1<TD>symmetric with respect to a vertical mirror plane perpendicular to the principal axis
<TR><TD>subscript 2<TD>anti-symmetric with respect to a vertical mirror plane perpendicular to the principal axis
<TR><TD>
<TR><TD>subscript g<TD>symmetric with respect to a center of symmetry (German: "gerade") 
<TR><TD>subscript u<TD>anti-symmetric with respect to a center of symmetry (German: "ungerade)

<TR><TD>prime (')<TD>symmetric with respect to a mirror plane horizontal to the principal rotational axis
<TR><TD>double prime ('')<TD>anti-symmetric with respect to a mirror plane horizontal to the principal rotational axis

The standard convention taxes the Z-axis as the principal axis of the system and the YZ-plane as
the principal plane.<BR><BR>
