<P>
Even though the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)</FONT> is defined
in mass-weighted cartesian coordinates, other choices exist to follow the minimum energy
reaction pathway in <I>Gaussian</I>. The default selection of mass-weighted cartesian coordinates
need not, but can be specified more explicitly with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=MassWeighted</FONT> or <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=MW</FONT><BR><BR>

Other options include the calculation in cartesian coordinates without mass-weighing, giving
significantly different results in systems in which light and heavy elements are directly
connected (e.g. hydrogen atom transfer reactions). This choice is selected with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=Cartesian</FONT><BR><BR>

A third choice uses an internal coordinate system as given in the input file:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">irc=Internal</FONT><BR><BR>

In some rare cases, reaction path calculations lead to one product in mass-weighted
cartesian coordinates and to another product in cartesian coordinates (without mass-weighing).
In most cases, however, the same products are reached in either coordinate system.<BR><BR>
