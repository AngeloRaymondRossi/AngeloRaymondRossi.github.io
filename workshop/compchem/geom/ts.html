<P>
The search for transition states is similar to searches for local minima in that an 
attempt is made to minimize the gradient of the energy with respect to structural coordinates.
In contrast to minima, however, transition states are located on a hilltop with respect to
one of the coordinates, while they are minima with respect to the others. Three different strategies
exist to search for transition states, which will be discussed in the following:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">1) scanning the potential energy surface</FONT> (a global approach)<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">2) walking uphill to the transition state</FONT> (a local approach)<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">3) automated global search algorithms</FONT><BR><BR>

Before going into some more detail, a comment on the term <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">transition state</FONT> 
appears appropriate. <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">States</FONT> are typically defined through their thermodynamic
properties and not through their structural characteristics. What will be described in the following
is, strictly speaking, the search for a vibrationless structure corresponding to the idealized transition
state at a temperature of 0K. Since "structures of transition states" is an awkward term to use,
we will talk about <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">transition states</FONT> in the following.<BR><BR>
