A detailed account of how thermochemical values are calculated in <I>Gaussian</I>
by by Joseph W. Ochterski (<I>Gaussian Inc.</I>) is available 
<A HREF=http://www.gaussian.com/g_whitepap/thermo.htm>here</A> as pdf and html
file.<BR><BR>

A number of constants and conversion factors helpful in thermochemical calculations can be
found <A HREF="../constants.html">here</A>.<BR><BR>

The thermochemical analysis in <I>Gaussian</I> is based on the harmonic vibrational frequencies 
calculated before and predicts by default thermochemical values for 298.15K and 1.0 atm.
The key thermochemical properties are:<BR><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=0>
<TR>
<TD valign=top>E<SUB>tot</SUB>
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<TD>the total electronic energy E<SUB>tot</SUB> as calculated by a given theoretical model. This is the 
energy of the molecular system under study relative to separate nuclei and electrons.
Remember that semiempirical methods such as AM1 use a different point of reference and 
produce heats of formation. Taking the dihydrogen molecule H<SUB>2</SUB> as calculated
at the Hartree-Fock level in combination with the standard 6-31G basis set (HF/6-31G) as an example,
the total energy of the system at its equilibrium position (H-H = 72.996 pm) amounts to
-1.12682782541 hartree. This result appears in the output file before any other thermochemical
data as:<BR>

<TD valign=top>ZPVE</TD>
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>the zero point vibrational energy ZPVE (or ZPE) results from the vibrational motion of
molecular systems even at 0 K and is calculated for a harmonic oscillator
model as a sum of contributions from all <I>i</I> vibrational modes of the system:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="thermo1_1.gif"><BR>

For the H<SUB>2</SUB> example cited above there is only one vibrational mode with a wavenumber 
of 4646.1744 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. With 0.5hc = 2.27827*10<SUP>-6</SUP> cm hartree we obtain a
zero point vibrational energy of 0.010585 hartree. This result is given in the <I>Gaussian</I>
output file as:<BR>

E<SUB>tot</SUB> and the zero point vibrational energy ZPVE:<BR><BR>

<TD valign=top>E(0-298)
<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<TD>is the thermal correction to the internal energy at 298.15K and is given as a sum over 
four components for contributions from electronic, vibrational, rotational and translational 
degrees of freedom:<BR><BR>

E(0-298) = dE<SUB>el</SUB> + dE<SUB>vib</SUB> + dE<SUB>rot</SUB> + dE<SUB>trans</SUB><BR><BR>

The first of these terms dE<SUB>el</SUB> describes the contribution of 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">electronically excited states</FONT> to the internal energy of the system. 
With excitation energies even to the first 
electronically excited state being much higher than k<SUB>B</SUB>T at room termperature
and with the zero point of energy taken as the electronic energy of the ground electronic
state, there is usually no contribution to the internal energy from occupation of
electronically excited states at room termperature.<BR><BR>

By far the largest contribution to the internal energy at room temperature stems from 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">vibrational degrees of freedom</FONT>, the zero point vibrational energy 
being one important component. The occupation of higher vibrational levels gives rise to an 
additional contribution dE<SUB>vib</SUB> which can be calculated according to:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="thermo1_3.gif"><BR><BR>

The vibrational temperature of each mode <I>i</I> is not just a helpful quantity for evaluation
of E(0-298) using the above equation, but also serves as a qualitative guideline for 
the extend of thermal excitation of vibrational modes. For the example of H<SUB>2</SUB> there 
is only one vibrational mode and thus only one vibrational temperature listed in the output file:<BR><BR>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
VIBRATIONAL TEMPERATURES:   6684.77
          (KELVIN)
</FONT></PRE>

This vibrational temperatur is so much larger than 298.15 K that vibrational excitation can
safely be excluded. The internal energy at 298.15 K due to vibrational motion is therefore
practically identical to the zero point vibrational energy of 6.642 kcal/mol.<BR><BR> 

The spacing of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">rotational energy levels</FONT> is much narrower than 
that of vibrational energy levels. An approximate formula for the contribution of rotational 
energy levels to the internal energy at room temperature (or above) is:<BR><BR>


dE<SUB>rot</SUB> = RT<BR><BR>

This implies that there is no rotational motion at 0 K and that the contribution of
rotational motion to the internal energy at 298.15K is 0.5925 kcal/mol (or 2.479 kJ/mol).<BR><BR>

The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">translational energy</FONT> of an ideal gas dE<SUB>trans</SUB> 
at temperature <I>T</I> is given (in molar quantities) as<BR><BR>

dE<SUB>trans</SUB> = 3/2 RT<BR><BR>

implying that at 0 K there is no contribution to the internal energy from
translational motion, but that the translational energy increases linearly with
increasing absolute temperature. At 298.15 K this amounts to 0.8887 kcal/mol (or 3.7185 kJ/mol).

The overall value for E(0-298) is not listed explicitly in the output
file, but appears together with the ZPVE as "Thermal correction to Energy":<BR>
