<B>Selecting a Structure</B><BR>
One of the first conditions that must be satisfied in order to perform an accurate
calculation of vibrational frequencies is that the underlying molecular structure 
represents a stationary point, that is, all first derivatives of the energy with 
respect to nuclear coordinates must be essentially zero. Using the vibrational 
frequency spectrum for the dihydrogen molecule (H-H) as an example, one can show 
that <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">small deviations from the equilibrium structure</FONT> 
can quickly lead to large errors 
in the calculated vibrational frequencies. The experimentally measured fundamental
vibrational mode is located at 4160 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. Expanding the vibrational frequencies
in a series containing harmonic and anharmonic terms, the corresponding (experimental) harmonic 
frequency is 4401 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. The following values are obtained at the HF/6-31G 
level of theory using structures optimized to different accuracy:<BR><BR>

All six structures summarized in the table above have rather similar total energies, the 
energy difference between the most favorable structure (last entry) and the least
favorable structure (first entry) being less than 1 kJ/mol. The structural differences 
for these two structures amount to less than 1% (only 0.5 pm) in the H-H bond distance, 
giving rise to a residual gradient for the least favorable structure of 3.86*10<SUP>-3</SUP>au. 
Compared to these differences in structure, energy and gradient, the changes in the
calculated vibrational frequencies are much more pronounced. For a linear molecule
with two atoms we expect only one real vibrational mode in addition to five near-zero
modes describing translational and rotational motion. This latter expectation is not 
fullfilled for the first five entries in the table as in particular
the two rotational modes are far from zero. The H-H stretching mode also suffers from
the residual gradient, showing variations of almost 80 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. That the
predicted harmonic frequency for the H-H streching mode appears to converge
to a value further away from the experimentally measured one with decreasing residual
gradient is primarily due to deficiencies of both the Hartree-Fock model as well as 
the small basis set (see below), but not a consequence of insufficient geometry optimization.

Similar results are obtained with other theoretical methods whose second derivatives cannot
be calculated analytically and thus require a numerical algorithm. This is the case for the 
semiempirical AM1 method:<BR><BR>

We observe that the AM1 value converges to 4342 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> with increasing accuracy of 
the geometry optimization. Again we note a large variation in predicted vibrational frequencies
with an increasing residual gradient. In contrast to the HF results discussed before the
five translational and rotational modes cannot be converged to very small values now.
This is a consequence of additional problems of numerical vibrational frequency calculations
(see below).<BR><BR>

<B>Selecting an Algorithm</B><BR>
Calculation of the force constant matrix (Hessian) can be performed with two different algorithms:<BR><BR>

1) Using an analytical algorithm. The keyword for this option in <I>Gaussian</I> is<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">freq=Analytic</FONT><BR><BR>

and it is the default for those theoretical methods, for which analytical second derivatives
are available. The latter include Hartree-Fock theory (HF), all density functional methods (DFT),
as well as MP2. Analytical calculation of the force constants is significantly faster and
also more accurate than the alternative approach:<BR><BR>

2) Using a numerical method. The keyword for this option in <I>Gaussian</I> is<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">freq=Numerical</FONT><BR><BR>

and it is the default for methods for which analytical second derivatives are not
available in <I>Gaussian</I> such as all semiempirical methods. For this option, 
the algorithm involves double displacements of all centers
in all three cartesian coordinates. The step size used in this procedure can be
specified with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">freq=(Numerical,Step=N)</FONT><BR><BR>

N being the size of the step in units of 0.0001 Angstroms. The default value for N is 100 in
semiempirical calclations. Smaller values require a somewhat tighter convergence criterion 
for the energy calculations as the unperturbed and perturbed structures are structurally and
energetically rather similar. This can be specified with<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">scf=(Conver=n)</FONT><BR><BR>

which sets the convergence criterion in energy calculations to 10<SUP>-n</SUP> Hartree on two 
successive SCF iterations. The default for semiempirical calculations such as AM1 is n=6, but
values of n=7 or 8 are more appropriate once the step size in numerical second derivative calculations
is less than N=50. Using these options, the vibrational frequency calculation for H<SUB>2</SUB> (AM1 level, 
H-H distance = 67.659 pm) can be
modified as follows (the principal stretching vibration is again shown in bold):<BR><BR>

</TABLE><BR><BR>

The last entry in this table marks the limits of numerical accuracy that can be achieved with this approach.<BR><BR>


<B>Differentiating Ground and Transiton States</B><BR>
Pushing the limits of vibrational frequency calculations is sometimes necessary in order to achieve unequivocal
characterization of minima and transition states on the potential energy surface. While minima are expected to 
show 6 very low frequencies in their vibrational frequency spectrum (3 for translational and 3 for rotational 
motions in a non-linear system) one large negative and 6 very small frequencies are expected for a transition state. 
The vibrational spectra calculated for methanol (CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH) will be used as an example. For this system 
one would expect 3*6 - 6 = 12 true vibrational modes. The lowest seven vibrational modes are shown in the 
following tables, first for the staggered and then for the eclipsed conformer (HF/6-31G(d) results):<BR><BR>

</TABLE><BR>

This first conformer shows one larger imaginary frequency (-37 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>), then three close-to-zero values, two small positive vibrations
of 16 and 28 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> and finally one larger vibrational mode at 344 cm<SUP>-1</SUP>. Is this a transition state or a local minimum?
Even though we are clearly not having one large imaginary frequency in combination with sixe close-to-zero values as expected
for a transition state, the six lowest vibrational frequencies are not all that close to zero. The second entry in the table above
shows that a clear case can be made for a local minimum after reoptimization to a higher convergence criterion.<BR><BR>

Geometry optimization of the eclipsed conformer of methanol using loose convergence criteria leads to a first structure
whose vibrational frequency spectrum contains a number of imaginary vibrational frequencies (first entry
in the following table):<BR><BR>

Reoptimization of the same structure with tighter convergence criteria leads to a much clearer result and we can recognize
that the lowest true vibrational mode of the staggered conformer at 348 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> turns into an imaginary mode
of 351 cm<SUP>-1</SUP> in the eclipsed structure. Both modes describe rotational motion around the central C-O bond.

<B>Scaling Vibrational Frequencies</B><BR>
A final point concerns the accuracy obtained in vibrational frequency calculations as a function of
the theoretical method used. In many cases, the experimentally measured values will differ significantly
from those calculated theoretically. One source of discrepancy is that experimental values are often
measured <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">in solution</FONT> while calculated values refer to the 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">gas phase</FONT>. A second source of error is the
assumption of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">harmonic approximation</FONT>. There is, however, also a 
method-dependent difference between
calculated and experimentally measured harmonic vibrational frequencies in the gas phase. For more
economical methods such as HF or AM1, the deviations typically range around 10%. In order to account
for this <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">systematic deviation</FONT>, all vibrational frequencies can be scaled 
(=multiplied with the
same value) down to fit the experimental harmonic frequencies. Radom et al. have published a list
of recommended scale factors for frequently used theoretical methods in <I>J. Phys. Chem.</I> <B>1996</B>, 
<I>100</I>, 16502. A small selection is:<BR><BR>

<TABLE BORDER=2 FRAME=box>
<TR ALIGN=center><TH>method<TH>scale<BR>factor<TH>rms<BR>deviation (cm<SUP>-1</SUP>)
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>AM1<TD>0.9532<TD>126 
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>PM3<TD>0.9761<TD>159 
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/6-31G(d)<TD>0.8953<TD>50 
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>MP2(FC)/6-31G(d)<TD>0.9427<TD>61
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>QCISD(FC)/6-31G(d)<TD>0.9537<TD>37
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>BLYP/6-31G(d)<TD>0.9945<TD>45
<TR ALIGN=center><TD>B3LYP/6-31G(d)<TD>0.9614<TD>34
</TABLE><BR>

It is clear from these results that semiempirical methods such as AM1 and PM3 will, even after
scaling, not be particularly reliable in predicting vibrational spectra. Rather good results can
be obtained either from highly correlated, expensive methods such as QCISD, or from hybrid
density functional calculations such as B3LYP.<BR><BR>
