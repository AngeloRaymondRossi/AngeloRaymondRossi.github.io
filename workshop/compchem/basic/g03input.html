<P>
The following is a typical Gaussian input file, using a single point energy calculation
on formaldehyde (HF/6-31G(d) level) as an example:<BR>

The first line of the input file: 

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
%mem=6000000 
</FONT> 
</PRE>

specifies how much memory is available for this calculation (in words). The default value 
(if nothing is specified) amounts to 6000000 words (corresponding to 48MB on a 32bit 
operating system). This information can also be specified with<BR>

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
%mem=48MB 
</FONT> 
</PRE>

The second line of the input file:

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
%chk=/scratch/test1.chk
</FONT>
</PRE>

defines a binary "checkpoint" file to which important results are written. If no file name
is supplied in the input file, the checkpoint files are generated during program execution, 
but deleted on successful termination of the program. The line directly following these two 
lines is the first one absolutely necessary for the program to execute at all and contains 
keywords defining the major steps of the calculation to be performed.

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
#P HF/6-31G(d) scf=tight
</FONT>
</PRE>

Here a HF/6-31G(d) single point calculation is done. The keywords must be preceded by the "#" sign.
Inclusion of "P" provides additional output. The keyword line can actually be longer than one physical
line and is concluded by one additional blank line. Following the blank line starts the comments section
(in free format) providing space for any type of comment. It is good practice to include the name of
the input file also here together with a short description of the job. The comments section is concluded
by one additional blank line.

Before specifying the structure of the system, the overall charge of the system and the overall
spin multiplicity must be given. The spin multiplicity "1" describes a singlet state, "2" a
doublet state, "3" a triplet state . . . .<BR>

The structure of the system is described in the lines directly following the charge/spin multiplicity
information. Beware of additional blank lines in this case! In the current example the structure
of formaldehyde is described in an internal coordinate system on 11 lines. The geometry specification 
section is concluded by at least one blank line (more doesn`t hurt).

A series of separate calculations can be combined into one input file by separating
the various input sections with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Link1</FONT> comand. The following
example demonstrates how the energy of formaldehyde can be calculated with two different
theoretical methods (here HF/6-31G(d) and AM1):<BR><BR>

Please observe that the geometry of the system is only given explicitly for the first
of these calculations. The second job step (AM1 energy calculation) reads the geometry
from the checkpoint file <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/scratch/test1.chk</FONT> using the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">geom=check</FONT> command. This will only work correctly
if there are TWO BLANK LINES separating the two parts of this compound job.<BR><BR>
