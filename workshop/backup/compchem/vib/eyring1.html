<CENTER><H2>Dependence of Reaction Rates on Temperature</H2></CENTER>
<HR>


<P>
Rate constants for chemical reactions are known to depend strongly on the
reaction temperature. One well known empirical relationship expressing this dependence 
is the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Arrhenius equation</FONT> (1):<BR><BR>

k = A exp(-E<SUB>a</SUB>/RT)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<BR><BR>

The important parameters in this relationship are the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">activation energy</FONT>
E<SUB>a</SUB> (in units of kJ/mol or kcal/mol) and the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">preexponential factor</FONT>
A. The latter is given in the same units as the rate constant itself ([s<SUP>-1</SUP>] for
a first order reaction and [l mol<SUP>-1</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>] for a second order reaction).<BR><BR>

A second expression used to describe the temperature dependence of reaction rate constants
is the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Eyring equation</FONT> (2) that results from transition state
theory  :<BR><BR>

k =  (k<SUB>B</SUB>T/h) (1/c<SUP>n</SUP>) exp(-dG**/RT)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)<BR><BR>

Here the first part of the equation contains only Boltzmann's constant k<SUB>B</SUB> and Planck's
constant h as well as the absolute temperature T (in [K]). The second part accounts for the concentration
dependence of the rate constant, c being the reference concentration of the reaction. The exponent
n assumes a value of 0 for a first order reaction and of 1 for a second order reaction. The third
part of equation (2) contains the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">activation free enthalpy</FONT> dG** of 
the reaction which, according to equ. (3) is directly related to the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">activation 
enthalpies</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">activation entropies</FONT>:<BR><BR>

dG** = dH** - TdS**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)<BR><BR>

The activation parameters of the Arrhenius and Eyring equations of a first order
reaction are related as follows:<BR><BR>

E<SUB>a</SUB> = dH** + RT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)<BR><BR>

A = (c k<SUB>B</SUB>T/h) exp(dS**/R)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)<BR><BR>

In particular the difference between Arrhenius activation energy E<SUB>a</SUB> and the 
activation enthalpy dH** are quite small and numerically close to the accuracy attained
in most experiments (RT = 2.5 kJ/mol at 298.15K). These two energies are therefore
frequently used interchangeably in the literatur to define the activation barrier of
a reaction.
