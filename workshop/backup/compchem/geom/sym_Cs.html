<P>
This point group contains only two symmetry operations:<BR><BR>

<B>E</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the identity operation<BR>
<B>&sigma;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; a mirror plane<BR><BR>

A simple example for a C<sub>s</sub> symmetric molecule is methanol 
(CH<sub>3</sub>OH) in its staggered conformation, here in its 
HF/6-31G(d) optimized structure:<BR>

In this case the symmetry of the system is reflected in the Z-Matrix
only through the use of identical variable names for hydrogen atoms
H5 and H6 and through constraining atoms 1 - 4 to the symmetry plane.
This reduces the number of independent structural variables 
from 12 (for an asymmetric, non-linear molecule containing six 
centers) to 8 and thus accelerates geometry optimizations.<BR><BR>

Molecular orbitals as well as harmonic vibrations (if calculated) 
are labeled according to their symmetry properties as belonging to
one of the two irreducible representations (<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A'</FONT> 
and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A''</FONT>) of the C<sub>s</sub>
point group. Those properties belonging to irreducible representation
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A'</FONT> are symmetric to both the identity 
operation <B>E</B> as well as reflection through the mirror plane. 
Those properties belonging to irreducible representation 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">A''</FONT> are symmetric with respect to 
the identity operation <B>E</B> but antisymmetric with respect to
reflection through the mirror plane.
