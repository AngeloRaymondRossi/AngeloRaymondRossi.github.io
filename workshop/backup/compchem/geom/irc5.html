<CENTER><H2>The Huisgen Reaction of Acetylene with Hydrazoic Acid</H2></CENTER>
<HR>

<P>
Using the Huisgen reaction (1,3-dipolar cycloaddition) of acetylene (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>)
with hydrazoic acid (HN<SUB>3</SUB>)
as an example, the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> can be obtained in the following way. 
First locate the transition state from a suitable starting point. Using the Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) 
method, the transition state for this reaction has the following structure:<BR><BR>

The transition state is characterized through C-N and C-N(H) bond distances of 2.135 and 2.209 Angstroms,
respectively, and has a Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) total energy of -242.080935 Hartree. 
After transition state optimization, a copy of the checkpoint file containing the transition state structure is made
for the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> calculations (e.g. test1ircf.chk). From this copy, the
forward  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> calculation is then initiated using the following input:<BR><BR>

The forward  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> will be followed in this case for 20 steps with a step
size of 10. The geometry is read from the checkpoint file with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">geom=check</FONT>. 
Progress in these calculations can be monitored using the UNIX  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">grep</FONT> command 
on the string "POINTS" in the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> output file. The number of local optimization
iterations per <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> point can be monitored grep'ing on the string "STEPS".
A large number of these cycles is an indication for either having a bad Hessian matrix or too 
large a step size. In the current example the number of optimization cycles for each of the 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> points varies between 1 and 3, a good sign for choosing a reasonable
step size. This step size is, however, not large enough to complete the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> 
within 20 steps and a second job with an additional 20 steps is therefore added with:<BR><BR>

Please observe that the choice of "maxpoints" here includes the previous 20 as well as the additional
20 points. The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> calculations continue in this particular case without 
any problems until step
40 is reached and can be restarted for another 20 steps to reach overall 60 steps along the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT>  path.
Attempted restart for another 20 points then leads to convergence problems after overall 62 steps
and the job is aborted with the error message:<BR><BR>


<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">

 Optimization stopped.
    -- Number of steps exceeded,  NStep=  34

Despite this error message, <I>Gaussian</I> prints a summary of all points of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT>
pathway optimized before including cartesian coordinates as well as the energies. Optimization problems
such as those encountered here occur frequently at the end of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> calculations, 
where the potential levels off before reaching the actual product or reactant minimum. In the current case the
last point on the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> is located at C-N and C-N(H) bond distances of 3.0502
and 3.0548 Angstroms, respectively, and a Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) total energy of -242.108291 Hartree.
In order to identify the remaining structural and energetic differences between the last  
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> point and the following true minimum, it is good practice to optimized to 
the next local minimum:

#P Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) opt geom=check iop(1/7=30)

<IMG SRC="irc5c.gif"><BR><BR>

In this case, the true minimum is located at a Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) total energy of -242.111452 Hartree,
80.1 kJ/mol below the transition state and 8.3 kJ/mol below the endpoint of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT>
calculations. The structure of this reactant complex is characterized through very long C-N and C-N(H) 
bond distances, but a short (C)H-N(H) distance of only 2.35 Angstroms. This structure shares little 
similarity with most of the reaction pathway and is the result of the optimization of electrostatic 
interactions between the two reactants.
<BR><BR>

The same procedure as described above can be followed for the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">reverse</FONT> pathway. 
The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> algorithm works well for 55 points, when again the local geometry
optimization does not converge anymore. At this point the structure is characterized through C-N and C-N(H) 
bond distances of 1.392 and 1.379 Angstroms, respectively, and a Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) total energy of 
-242.220156 Hartree. Reoptimization of the last point on the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> then leads
to the fully optimized product of the Huisgen reaction with a total energy of -242.222319 Hartree and
C-N and C-N(H) bond distances of 1.366 and 1.356 Angstroms, respectively. The reaction product is thus
371.2 kJ/mol more favorable than the transition state and 291.1 kJ/mol more favorable than the reactant
complex.<BR><BR>

The occurence of oscillations during the constrained local optimizations are the most frequent 
problems encountered in <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> calculations. These oscillations can,
to some extend, be avoided using smaller step sizes in combination with tighter convergence
criteria. In case the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> algorithm continues to work until the
very end of the reaction pathway, the arrival at a minimum energy structure is indicated by
the message:<BR><BR>


<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">

Minimum found on this side of the potential

</FONT><BR><BR>

Despite this optimistic claim, the final structure obtrained in <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT>  
calculations may still have gradients, which are substantially larger than acccepted for true 
minimum energy
structures. It is therefore a good practice to subject the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">IRC</FONT> 
end point structures to a standard geometry optimization procedure.<BR><BR>
