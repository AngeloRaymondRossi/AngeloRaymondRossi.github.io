<P>
The generation of <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Tinker</FONT> input files for structures other
than peptides and nucleotides is most easily achievd through the combined use with other
programs. The following example uses <FONT COLOR="#000FF">GaussView</FONT> and 
<FONT COLOR="#000FF">MOLDEN</FONT> to generate input files for geometry optimization
and conformational search with <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Tinker</FONT>.<BR><BR>

The example chosen here explores the conformational space of n-propylcyclohexane. This system
can easily be constructed from the fragments available in the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">GaussView</FONT>
builder. After construction the molecule can be save as a standard <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Gaussian</FONT>
input file such as "cyc1.com". Conversion of this file to the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Tinker</FONT> input
file format is most easily achieved by reading in the file with <FONT COLOR="#000FF">molden42 cyc1.com</FONT>
and by writing out the structure as "cyc1.xyz" using the "Write" menu in <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Molden</FONT>
specifying the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Tinker</FONT> file format. At this point the input file for the
system is as follows:<BR><BR>

The first line contains the number of atoms in the input file (here 27) together with a 
comment (here stating that the structure has been generated with molden). The second
line specifies the first center with running number "1", being of atom type "C" (a carbon atom),
followed by the xyz coordinates, the first atom being located at the origin of the
coordinate system in this particular case. The sixth column specifies the MM3 force field
atom type (here 1) and (through a maximum of four additional n umbers) the connectivity of the
current center. Center 1 is in this case connected to centers 2 and 6 (two carbon atoms)
and to centers 9 and 10 (two hydrogen atoms). It is clear from this connectivity that
atom 1 must be one of the ring carbon atoms in the cyclohexane ring. The other centers
are defined in an analogous manner.<BR><BR>

Before being able to explore the conformational space of the system we still need to generate
an appropriate keyword file "cyc1.key" defining the force field to be used for the present study.
The most appropriate force field for hydrocarbons and related organic molecules ist the MM3 force
field and a minimal keyword file will accordingly be:<BR><BR>

</FONT><BR>

This line points to the MM3 parameter file that can also be inspected <A HREF="MM3params.html">here</A>.
The atom types 1 and 5 are described at the very beginning of the parameter file as
belonging to sp<SUP>3</SUP> hybridized carbon atoms as present in alkanes and as hydrogen
atoms connected to carbon atoms:<BR><BR>

Searching the conformational space can again be achieved with the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">scan</FONT>
program from the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Tinker</FONT> program suite. An appropriate command file
named "cyc1.run" including some sorting and cleanup is as follows:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000FF">
scan cyc1 0 5 100 0.0001<BR>
grep "Map" cyc1.log | cat > tempo<BR>
sort tempo -nr -k 6,6n -o cyc1.list<BR>
rm tempo<BR>
</FONT><BR>

After making the file executable this command file can be executed with:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000FF">
./cyc1.run >& cyc1.log &<BR>
</FONT><BR>

Conformational search with the MM3 force field gives in this particular case rise to 7 different 
conformers with the following MM3 force field energies (in kcal/mol):<BR><BR>

The structures of these conformational minima are located in a series of files called
"cyc1.001" . . . "cyc1.007". A combined coordinate file can be generated from
these single structure files using the<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000FF">
archive<BR>
</FONT><BR>

program of the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Tinker</FONT> program suite, which works quite
selfexplanatory. Using the UNIX command "cat" it is also possible to combine the 
single structure files into one archive, now also reflecting the sequence of
relative stability:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000FF">
cat cyc1.001 cyc1.003 cyc1.006 cyc1.004 cyc1.007 cyc1.002 cyc1.005 > cyc1.arc<BR>
</FONT><BR>

The single structure files as well as the archive files generated with <FONT COLOR="#000FF">archive</FONT>
or the <FONT COLOR="#000FF">cat</FONT> command can be read with <FONT COLOR="#000FF">Molden</FONT> and
converted from there again to input files for quantum mechanical calculations with 
<FONT COLOR="#000FF">Gaussian</FONT>. On analyzing the results obtained for n-propylcyclohexane you will
realize that the conformers differ in the orientation of the n-propyl side chain only. This is due to
the conformational search algorithm used in <FONT COLOR="#000FF">scan</FONT>.
