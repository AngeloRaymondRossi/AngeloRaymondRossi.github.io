<H2>Force Field Calculations in <I>Gaussian 03</I></H2> 
</CENTER>
<HR>
Despite the fact that <I>Gaussian</I> is a program for quantum mechanical
calculations, it also offers some possibilities for performing force field 
calculations with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">AMBER</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Dreiding</FONT>,
and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">UFF</FONT> force fields. In contrast to quantum mechanical
calculations, the input files for these types of calculations are slightly more
complex as the force field calculations require clear specifications of
atom type and connectivity. The following is an input file for the optimization 
of methanol with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">AMBER</FONT> force field:<BR>

The definition of the geometry of the system differs from that used in quantum mechanics
calculations in two points:<BR><BR>

1) The atom types are defined through atomic symbols as well as 
a force field atom type. The first line of the above input:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
H-H1-
</FONT><BR><BR>

defines a hydrogen atom which is connected to a carbon atom carying one electronegative
substituent. The same atom type is chosen for hydrogen atoms H5 and H6. A different atom 
type <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">-HO</FONT> is selected for hydrogen atom 4 connected to the 
oxygen atom. The atom type definitions are those defined for the AMBER force field. A full 
list of possible atom types can be found <A HREF="parm96.html">here</A>.<BR><BR>

2) The input file now also includes information on the atom connectivity.
Prompted by the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">geom=connectivity</FONT> keyword the
program reads after the end of the Z-Matrix definition additional lines (one
per atom) that define the bonds present in the system. The line:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
1 2 1.0
</FONT><BR><BR>

defines a bond of bond order 1.0 between centers 1 and 2. This type of information
is given once for every bond contained in the system. Based on a proximity criterion
the program can also define bonds by itself. This does, of course, only work properly 
if the starting geometry is chosen well enough.<BR>

The <I>Gaussian</I> output file contains rather limited information on the
geometries generated during the geometry optimzation if only the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">opt</FONT>
keyword is being used. This has to do with the original purpose of the implementation of
force field methods in <I>Gaussian</I> for combination with quantum mechanical methods.
In these types of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">QM/MM</FONT> methods several microiterations are
performed for the force field subsystem before one geometry optimization step is performed
for the quantum mechanical system. Only after the latter a new geometry is written to the output file. 
A full reflection of geometry changes during optimization can be achieved using either the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">opt=nomicro</FONT> keyword or the definition of a particular
coordinate system with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">opt=Z-Matrix</FONT> or 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">opt=Redundant</FONT> keywords.<BR><BR>

For each structure along the optimization pathway <I>Gaussian</I> reports the energy of the
system as:<BR>

The energy listed here is that defined through the bonded and non-bonded interactions present 
in the system, the hypothetical "unstrained" state serving as the zero point of
energy.<BR><BR>

One additional aspect of force field calculations concerns the calculation of
Coulomb interactions between non-bonded centers. If not specified in the
input file, no charges are assigned to the atoms of the system
and no Coulomb interactions are calculated. If, however, charges are included
in the input file, the Coulomb interactions are calculated. This also changes the
definition of the force field itself and the reported energy of the system is not
directly comparable anymore to that without Coulomb interactions. The following
input file for methanol contains charges derived with the CHELPG scheme at the HF/6-31G(d)
level of theory:<BR><BR>

Please observe that the charge parameters directly follow the atom type specification
without a blank.<BR><BR>

The process of building an appropriate input file for force field calculations can be
vastly facilitated using <I>GaussView</I>. For this purpose we will use <I>GaussView</I>s
facility to generate complete input files for any type of calculation. After designing
the system of interest using, for example, the fragment library, select 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Gaussian...</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Calculate</FONT>
pull down menu. In the popup window select <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Mechanics..</FONT> in the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Method:</FONT> panel and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Amber</FONT> as the
force field model. After checking the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Write Connectivity</FONT> 
button in the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">General</FONT> menue, you can generate the input file selecting the
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Edit..</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Save</FONT> buttons
and provide a file name. The generated file then appears in a new window, which can be
closed without any changes. The subsequently appearing submit prompt can be canceled. 
This type of aborted job submission generates the file with all necessary connectivity information
and atom type declarations. If contained in the fragment library, atomic charges are
also included.<BR><BR>
