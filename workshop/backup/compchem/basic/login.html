<HR>

In case you have managed to log in successfully with the correct user name and password,<BR>
you will see the (default) <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GNOME</FONT> desktop of the Ubuntu LINUX distribution in front<BR> 
of you. The most important part of this desktop is the panel at the top of the screen.<BR>
At the far left of this panel are the main menu entries "Anwendungen" and "System". From<BR>
there you will have access to all of the basic programs we will need during the course.<BR> 
The most important tools we will use during the course are as follows:<BR><BR>

1) Starting the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Firefox</FONT> web browser<BR>
All of the documentation for the computational chemistry class (including the one your are<BR>
reading right now) as well as a multitude of information on computational and theoretical<BR> 
chemistry available in the internet requires a web browser. The one we will be using in this<BR> 
class is called  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Firefox</FONT> and can be started as follows: a) go to the "Anwendungen" menu;<BR> 
b) select the "Internet" option; c) from the list of available programs select the "Firefox" browser.<BR><BR>  

2) Starting a  <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">shell window</FONT><BR>
Most of the things we will do during the class requires a line-oriented command interface<BR>
or "shell". We can access such a shell as follows: a) go to the "Anwendungen" menu;<BR> 
b) select the "Zubeh&ouml;r" option; c) select "Terminal".<BR><BR> 

Open shell windows can be closed by either typing "exit" on the command line, or by pushing<BR> 
the small "X"-button in the upper right corner of the window.<BR><BR>

Frequently used programs can also be accessed through symbols located on the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GNOME</FONT> panel.<BR>
You can add symbols to the panel by positioning the mouse point on the panel, pushing the right<BR>
mouse button, select "Zum Panel hinzuf&uuml;gen .." from the pop-up window, then<BR> 
"Anwendungsstarter .." and finally select "Firefox" from the list of Internet programs.<BR><BR>

Finally, you should log out from your computer at the end of the class using the "Abmelden" option<BR> 
at the bottom of the "System" menu. Please, after logging out, DON'T SWITCH OFF THE COMPUTER!!!<BR><BR>
