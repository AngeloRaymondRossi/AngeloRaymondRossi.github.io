<H2> Running Gaussian Jobs on the CIP-Cluster </H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
Running <I>Gaussian 03</I> jobs through the PBS queueing system on the 
CIP-F cluster requires the combination of input information for the 
queueing system and for <I>Gaussian 03</I>. A typical example named 
<I>test1</I> has the following structure:<BR><BR>

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">

#PBS -l mem=128mb
#PBS -q long
setenv g03root /usr/local

setenv GAUSS_ARCHDIR /usr/local/g03b3

The first three lines of this input file starting with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">#</FONT> 
symbol are pbs-commands that direct the pbs queueing system to execute all following 
commands in the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">csh</FONT> environment and submit this job to 
queue <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">long</FONT>. A maximum of 128mb is allocated to the job. 
Including the queue-name in the input file is not mandatory, but facilitates working 
with multiple jobs on a compute cluster. The following lines starting with 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">setenv</FONT> define <I>Gaussian</I>-specific environment 
variables.<BR><BR>

The <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">cat</FONT> command is then used to create a file called 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">"$GAUSS_SCRDIR/$PBS_JOBNAME"</FONT>.
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">GAUSS_SCRDIR</FONT> is one of the environment variables set 
before to designate the scratch directory for <I>Gaussian 03</I> (a directory for 
large files that will be deleted after the job terminates successfully). The 
environment variable <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PBS_JOBNAME</FONT> is provided by the 
pbs queueing system itself and defaults to the name of the script file (here: test1). 
What the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">cat</FONT> command does in this 
particular example is to copy all lines that follow until the 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">EOF</FONT> (end of file) marker into the file 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/scratch/test1</FONT>.<BR><BR>

The remaining lines after the EOF marker first generate an empty file in the users 
working directory indicating the name of the node on which the calculation will be 
executed and then execute <I>Gaussian 98</I> using 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/scratch/test1</FONT> as an input file and 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/scratch/test1.log</FONT> as the output file. After job completion 
the output file <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/scratch/test1.log</FONT> will be moved to the 
working directory of the user. The location of the latter is reflected in the pbs 
environment variable <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">$PBS_O_WORKDIR</FONT>. The value of this 
variable is set upon submit time and defaults to the subdirectory containing the job 
file. A second (binary) file containing additional information of the calculation 
called <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">/scratch/test1.chk</FONT> will also be moved to the 
users working directory. The final <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">rm</FONT> command cleans 
up everything that is left over.<BR><BR>

The advantage of reading and writing input and output files to /scratch instead of the 
users home directory directly has to do with the fact that the former is a local file 
system, while the latter is accessible only through a file server (here cicum1). In case 
the file server responds too slowly, the <I>Gaussian 03</I> jobs will simply terminate 
with a file I/O error. Access to a local file system such as /scratch is much more 
reliable. Unfortunately, there are also two disadvantages to this concept. First, as the 
/scratch directories are local file systems on local disks, they are accessible only 
from one single node of the cluster. This implies that a job running on cicum82 can't 
access the files located in the /scratch directory on cicum93. Second, each /scratch 
directory is open to all users of the cluster. This becomes problematic when multiple 
users choose identical file names such as <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">test1</FONT>. In case 
two users run a job in sequence on the same cluster node using identical file names, 
the second job will typically die due to file access restrictions. This problem can be 
circumvented by choosing appropriate job and file names.<BR><BR>

The script described above can be extended with all common csh-commands. One particularly 
useful one consists in copying or renaming files before <I>Gaussian 03</I> executes. 
If, for example, results from a previous run are stored already in the binary checkpoint 
file named test1.chk, one could move this file first to the 
/scratch directory by inserting:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
cp $PBS_O_WORKDIR/$PBS_JOBNAME.chk $GAUSS_SCRDIR/$PBS_JOBNAME.chk<BR><BR>
</FONT>

directly before the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">touch</FONT> command in the above example.<BR><BR>

Finally this file can be submitted to the queueing system with <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">qsub test1</FONT>.
In case no queueing information has been included in the actual input file, this information can be 
added on submit time using, for example, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">qsub -l nodes=cicum92 test1</FONT>.<BR><BR>
