The program <A HREF=http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/~schaft/molden/molden.html>Molden</A> by Gijs Schaftenaar
at the <A HREF=http://www.cmbi.kun.nl/index.html>Centre for Molecular and Biomolecular Informatics</A>
is a very nice program to visualize the results of quantum chemical calculations. In contrast to GaussView
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT> reads a number of different input and output file formats,
including those of <I>Gaussian 98</I> and <I>Gaussian 03</I>. In order to start <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT>
type:<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">molden &</FONT><BR>
<BR>
on the command line. All program options can be accessed through the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden Control</FONT>
panel. In order to open a file, push the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Read</FONT> button and select the file from the
popup window. In some cases (more than 512 files in the directory) <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT> might
not display all files contained in a directory. Upon loading a file, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT> will
display the first structure encountered in this file. For geometry optimizations, this usually is the UNOPTIMIZED
structure. All other structures contained in the file can be obtained with the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Next</FONT>
button and all structures can be viewed in sequence by choosing <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Movie</FONT>. Using the command:<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">molden test1.log &</FONT><BR>
<BR>
it is also possible to load the file "test1.log" automatically after the program has started. New files can be generated
through pushing the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Write</FONT> button and supplying a file name.<BR>
<BR>
Display options are set with the buttons listed under <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">"Draw Mode:"</FONT>, their meaning
being selfexplanatory in most cases. The absolute size of the display and the position of the molecule(s) in the drawing
window can be adjusted with the options gathered next to the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">"Zoom:"</FONT> label.<BR>
<BR>
Several possibilities exist for moving the molecule around on the screen. Simple horizontal or vertical
translations can be affected using the arrow buttons in the lower right of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden Control</FONT>
panel. The molecule can be rotated in an "Old Style" or in a "Sticky Pointer" fashion. Selection of the mode
of rotation is made through the small button in the lower right corner of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden Control</FONT>
panel. The stepsize in the "Old Style" mode is controlled through the circular button in the middle of the
arrow keys of the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden Control</FONT> panel.<BR>
<BR>
The three buttons under the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">"Calculate:"</FONT> label can be used to measure distances,
bond angles and dihedral angles in the structure currently on display. Of particular value is the distance measurement,
that can be used to monitor the development of a bond distance along a reaction pathway or other sequence of multiple
structures (Choose <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Monitor</FONT> from the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden Calculate</FONT>
panel).<BR>
<BR>
A very usefull tool for following geometry optimizations can be found under <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">"Geom. conv."</FONT>
under the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Convergence</FONT> label, which produces a graphical display of the most important
parameters during a geometry optimization (total energies, step sizes, forces).<BR>
<BR>
In order to stop <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT>, push the button with the pirat flag on top.<BR>
<BR>
In case nothing works: on startup <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT> generates a file called "plot".
This requires the permission to write in that specific directory. Users therefore cannot usually start 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT> from directories of other users or system-wide importance.<BR><BR>

An updated version of <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Molden</FONT> (version 4.2) can be started using the command
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">molden42</FONT>.<BR><BR>
