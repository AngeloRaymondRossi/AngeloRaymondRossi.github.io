<H2> Pauling bond order</H2>

<HR>
The degree or order of bonding between two atoms cannot only be determined 
through analysis of the molecular wavefunction, but also through using the
bond distance/bond order correlation established by Linus Pauling. This
empirical scheme is particularly useful for comparing calculated
and experimentally determined data, but also has some value as a "post factum" 
analysis method. The approach is based on the assumption that bond orders
vary exponentially with bond distances. This can be expressed in a straightforward
manner with equation (1):<BR><BR>

n<SUB>x</SUB> = n<SUB>o</SUB> EXP((r<SUB>o</SUB> - r<SUB>x</SUB>)/c)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<BR><BR>

In equation (1) the bond order n<SUB>x</SUB> of a bond of length r<SUB>x</SUB>
is a function of a reference bond of length r<SUB>o</SUB>, whose bond order is
defined as n<SUB>o</SUB>. The constant c determines, how steeply the bond orders
change with bond distances. Very frequently the reference bond distance is that
of a single bond with n<SUB>o</SUB>=1.0.<BR><BR>

The original equation suggested by Pauling for single and double bonds uses
a value of c = 0.3 (black line). For the analysis of bond orders in transition states
this value leads to bond orders which are too small. For these structures
a value of c = 0.6 appears to be more appropriate (blue line).<BR><BR>

The calculation of bond orders n for ground state molecules will be demonstrated using
ethylene, butadiene, and benzene as example. The following structural data have been
calculated for these systems at the Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (distances in pm):<BR><BR>

The double bond in ethylene is used here as the reference systems for bonds with
bond order 2 at a bond length of 133.09 pm. Using Paulings original expression (c = 0.3) 
the bond orders in butadiene amount to 1.937 (C1-C2) and 1.312 (C2 - C3), and to 1.607 
for benzene. It is clear from this example, that the calculated bond orders always
depend on the chosen reference system!
