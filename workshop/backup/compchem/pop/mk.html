C. Singh and P. A. Kollman (<I>J. Comp. Chem.</I> <B>1984</B>, <I>5</I>, 129 - 145), atomic charges are fitted to reproduce the molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) at a number of points around the molecule. As a first step of the fitting procedure, the MEP is calculated at a number of gridpoints located on several layers around the molecule. The layersare constructed as an overlay of van der Waals spheres around each atom. All points located inside the van der Waalsvolume are discarded. Best results are achieved by sampling points not too close to the van der Waals surfaceand the van der Waals radii are therefore modified through scaling factors. The smallest layeris obtained by scaling all radii with a factor of 1.4. The default MK scheme then adds three more layers constructedwith scaling factors of 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0.<BR><BR><CENTER><IMG SRC="mk_1a.gif"><BR></CENTER><BR><BR>After evaluating the MEP at all valid grid points located on all four layers, atomic charges are derived that reproduce the MEP as closely as possible. The only additional constraint in the fitting procedure is that the sum of all atomic charges equals that of the overall charge of the system. An input file for calculating the MK charges for water at the Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory is:<BR><BR><PRE><TT>#P Becke3LYP/6-31G(d) <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">pop=MK</FONT> scf=(direct,tight)B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) MK charges for water (C2v structure)0  1O1H2  1  r2H3  1  r2  2  a3r2=0.96874547a3=103.6515355</TT></PRE><BR>The results of the fitting procedure appear in the regular <I>Gaussian</I> output file as:<BR><BR><PRE><TT>(Enter /scr1/g03/l602.exe) Merz-Kollman atomic radii used. **********************************************************************            Electrostatic Properties Using The SCF Density **********************************************************************       Atomic Center    1 is at   0.000000  0.000000  0.119748       Atomic Center    2 is at   0.000000  0.761565 -0.478990       Atomic Center    3 is at   0.000000 -0.761565 -0.478990     289 points will be used for fitting atomic charges Fitting point charges to eletrostatic potential Charges from ESP fit, RMS=   0.00251 RRMS=   0.11327: Charge=   0.00000 Dipole=     0.0000     0.0000    -2.1465 Tot=     2.1465              1     1  O   -0.746390     2  H    0.373195     3  H    0.373195</TT></PRE><BR>Charges derived in this way don't necessarily reproduce the dipole moment of the molecule.

The default value for N (and smallest meaningfullchoice) is 4. The actual positioning of the layers depends on their overall number. Thefirst layer is always located at 1.4 times the vdW distance. The increment of the scaling factorbetween subsequent layers is calculated according to the formula:<BR><BR>increment = 0.4/sqrt(nr. of layers)<BR><BR>Thus, if overall nine layers are used, the default increment of the scaling factor amounts to 0.133.A more flexible design of the layer structure is possible by setting the increment directly usingthe <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">iop(6/43=M)</FONT> keyword, M being the increment of the scaling factorin units of 0.01.<BR><BR><B>2) Using more grid points per layer</B><BR>The default density of grid points per unit area equals 1. This can be increased using the<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">iop(6/42=L)</FONT> keyword, L being the number of grid points per unitarea. Meaningful choices for L range from 1 to 6, but a systematic dependence of the calculatedcharges should not always be expected.<BR><BR>Details of the MK charge fitting pocedure can be dumped to the output file using the<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">iop(6/33=1)</FONT> keyword.<BR><BR>Charges calculated using the MK scheme show a similarlysmall dependence on the computational method employed and are thus considered superior to Mulliken charges. The following results calculated for water in its experimental gas phase structure (with r(O-H) = 95.72 pm and a(H-O-H) = 104.52<SUP>o</SUP>) illustrate this point:<BR><BR><TABLE BORDER=2 FRAME=box>	<TR ALIGN=center><TH>level of theory<TH><B><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&nbsp;&nbsp;MK&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT</B><TH>Mulliken	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/STO-3G<TD>-0.616<TD>-0.366	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/3-21G<TD>-0.873<TD>-0.728	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/6-31G(d)<TD>-0.807<TD>-0.866	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/6-311+G(2d,2p)<TD>-0.752<TD>-0.471	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/cc-pVDZ<TD>-0.746<TD>-0.305	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/cc-pVTZ<TD>-0.738<TD>-0.483	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>HF/cc-pVQZ<TD>-0.732<TD>-0.526	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>Becke3LYP/cc-pVDZ<TD>-0.694<TD>-0.255	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>Becke3LYP/cc-pVTZ<TD>-0.700<TD>-0.432	<TR ALIGN=center><TD>Becke3LYP/cc-pVQZ<TD>-0.695<TD>-0.487</TABLE><BR>While the Mulliken charges differ widely (between -0.255 and -0.866) with theoretical method and basis set choice, the MK charges are much less variable (between -0.616 and -0.873). Moreover, the MK charges are practically constant at either the Hartree-Fock or Becke3LYP level of theory provided that one of the correlation consistent basis sets is being used. Poor results are obtained even with the MK scheme with small basis sets such as STO-3G or 3-21G.<BR><BR>A detailed overview of the effects of the basis set and the Hamiltonian on the charge distribution in water can be found in: F.
