<P>
Geometry optimization of the input structure being the default for any
calculation with <I>MOPAC</I>, there is no particular need to add any keywords
for the geometry optimization to work at all. In case symmetry restrictions
should be imposed on the optimization process, this information must
be provided in addition to the actual starting structure and the 
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">SYMMETRY</FONT> keyword must be added to force
the use of symmetry information. The symmetry relations are added directly
after the geometry definition in the format:

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
(defining center),(symmetry relation),(defined center 1),(defined center 2) . . . 
</FONT>
</PRE>

The internal coordinate symmetry relations are given as integers with the
following meaning (only the most relevant relations are shown):

<PRE>
<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">
1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal bond lengths
2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal bond angles
3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal dihedral angles
14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dihedral angle varies as the negative of reference dihedral angle
15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bond length varies as half of the reference bond length
16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bond angle varies as half of the reference bond angle
17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bond angle varies as 180 - reference bond length

Several examples will be used to illustrate the formal definition of symmetry relations.<BR><BR>

Here only one symmetry relation is necessary that relates the bond length of H2 to the
bond length of H3 using symmetry relation 1. Please observe that the symmetry definitions
must be separated from the actual geometry definition by one blank line and that another
blank line must be added to terminate the symmetry input section. If given correctly
in the input file, all symmetry relations will be listed at the beginning of the output file
under the <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PARAMETER DEPENDENCE DATA</FONT> heading.<BR><BR>

In this particular case two dummy atoms (symbolized as XX) are used to define the
principal C<SUB>2</SUB> axis of the system and all variables are subsequently defined
relative to these two centers. The symmetry relations first define the equality of
bond distances for the oxygen and hydrogen atoms (symmetry relation 1) and then equal 
bond angles and dihedral angles for the hydrogen atoms (symmetry relations 2 and 3).<BR><BR>

One part of the symmetry information is given in this case as part of the 
Z-Matrix definition in that the dihedral angle for hydrogen atom 4 is set 
to 180.0 degrees and is not allowed to vary. The atoms 1 through 4 are thus
all located in the principal plane of the system. Only atoms H5 and H6 extend
below and above the plane and their bond distances, angles, and dihedral angles
are related to each other. Please observe that the dihedral angle of H6 varies
as the negative of the dihedral angle of H5 (symmetry relation 14).<BR><BR>

In contrast to geometry optimizations with <I>Gaussian</I>, point group changes
during geometry optimization will not be detected in MOPAC and will therefore
not lead to termination of program execution.<BR><BR>
