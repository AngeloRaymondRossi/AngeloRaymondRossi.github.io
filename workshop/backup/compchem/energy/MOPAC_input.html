Using the AM1 water optimization as an example, the following is a typical
MOPAC input file:<BR><BR>

The first line contains all keywords relevant to the current calculation:<BR><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">AM1</FONT> defines the theoretical method used, <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">PRECISE</FONT>
tightens up convergence criteria for all optimization processes (geometric or electronic)
by a factor of 100 and <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">EF</FONT> calls the Eigenvector following algorithm for
geometry optimization. <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">T=48H</FONT> sets the maximum runtime to 2 days beyond which
MOPAC will shut down the calculation in an orderly manner. By default MOPAC performs a geometry
optimization for the structure given in the input file. Thus there is no keyword to explicitly
define a geometry optimization.<BR><BR>

The second line of the input file is reserved for user comments (free format).<BR><BR>

After one blank line the geometry of the system is given using an internal coordinate
system, one center per line. Each line starts with the atomic symbol, followed by a bond
distance, a bond angle and a dihedral angle. Whether these parameters are varaibles or constants
during the geometry optimization is indicated by a trailing 0 (constant) or 1 (variable).
At the end of each line the connectivity of the sytstem is specified through three integers.
Using the third line as an example:<BR><BR>

we see that a hydrogen atom is connected to atom 1 with an intial distance of 1.0 angstroms and
forms a bond angle with atoms 1 and 2 with an initial value of 105.0 degrees. Both 
parameters are marked as variables.<BR><BR>
