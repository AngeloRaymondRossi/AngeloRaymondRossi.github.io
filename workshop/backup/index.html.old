<h1><u>Importance of Computational Chemistry</u></h1>
Open almost any chemistry journal, and you will probably encounter molecular modelling, 
where the theory of chemistry meets the reality of the laboratory experiment. 
To understand the real world behaviour of molecules, one must construct realistic models. 
Although the basic equations for doing so were derived some eighty years ago, the remarkable 
advances in computers have allowed access to modelling and the necessary computer resources. 
However, there is still lingering uncertainty 
and lack of confidence among experimental chemists both with respect to the computational results 
and with the layers of approximations that inevitably underpin the model.
<br>
<br>
It is relatively easy to purchase a chemistry computer application which can produce attractive pictures,
but the challenge still remains as to how to understand the underlying 
numerical results which come from equations. This workshop is very much a primer for experimental 
chemists who want to understand the results behind the equations and 
how modelling programs can achieve remarkable predictions for experiment.
<br>
<br>
Computational and theoretical chemistry provide fundamental insights into the structures, 
properties, and reactivities of molecules. As a result, 
theoretical calculations have become indispensable in various fields of chemical research and development. 
In this workshop, students will learn how the area of computational transition metal chemistry, using
examples to illustrate how theory impacts our understanding of experimental results, and how close 
collaboration between theoreticians and experimental chemists, can be mutually beneficial.
<br>
<br>
<h1><u>Motivation for the Workshop</u></h1>
This workshop will examine the use of computational chemistry in understanding the reactivity properties 
of transition metal complexes, addressing experimental difficulties with
calculations and vice versa. The impact of theoretical insights in specific experimental studies
of chemical reactions is considered, illustrating how theoretical results prompt further 
experimental studies.
<br>
<br>
Together, they illustrate some of the achievements that are possible with a fruitful union of experiment and theory.
<br>
<br>
Computational and theoretical approaches have now become indispensable in various fields of chemical research and development and have
entered the mainstream of bioinorganic, organometallic and transition metal chemistry. 
This workshop will focus on the area of computational and theoretical chemistry, 
applying modern computational techniques, including quantum chemical calculations 
and molecular dynamics, to studies of structure,
bonding, and reactivity of bioinorganic and organometallic compounds and transition metal complexes.
An overview of theory and computational techniques will be presented, together with examples, 
to illustrate the intersection between
theory and experiment and some of the achievements that have resulted from this interplay.
<br>
<br>
<h1><u>Computational Chemistry and High Performance Computing</u></h1>
<i>Using High Performance Computing for simulation is not just for experts.</i>
<br>
<br>
High Performance Computing (HPC) incorporates large computational resources, including fast 
processors with large memory and massive storage, to solve large computational
problems that would be intractable on common desktop devices. HPC environments include 
multiple processor servers with very fast compute and I/O interconnects, and
clusters of identical computers (typically Linux) with specialised application 
software designed to leverage aggregate capability.
<br>
<br>
Although High Performance Computing is crucial in all areas of science, it is particularly 
indispensable role in helping to solve a range of chemical problems.
The use of numerical simulation to tackle real-world problems has become standard practice 
and really taken off during the last decade. 
Radical improvements in computer hardware and software, and the development of more efficient 
computational algorithms, have facilitated the solution of crucial problems in chemistry.
<br>
<br>
Over the past several decades there have been major advances in our ability to computationally
evaluate the electronic structure of inorganic molecules, particularly transition metal systems. 
This advancement is due to an increase in computing power as well as improvements in quantum 
mechanical methods including Hartree-Fock and density functional theory (DFT) methods 
and in molecular dynamics methods. For example, improved pure and hybrid density functionals allow DFT
calculations with accuracy comparable to high-level Hartree-Fock treatments, and the results of
these calculations can now be evaluated by experiment.
<br>
<br>
When calculations are correlated to and supported by experimental data, they can provide
fundamental insight into the electronic structure of molecules and contribute to an understanding 
of physical properties and chemical reactivity. This interplay of theory, computation and experiment 
continues to expand and contributes to both an improved value of
experimental results and an improved accuracy of computational predictions.
<br>
<br>
This workshop will provide state-of-the-art material for quantum mechanical
and related methods, molecular dynamics, and their applications in the following order:
<b>
<ul>
<li>methods: implementation and use in describing bonding properties, energies, transition states and spectroscopic features. 
<li>applications: organic, inorganic, organometallic, and bioinorganic chemistry 
<li>impact: usefulness of electronic structure and molecular dynamics simulations on experimental results.
</ul>               
</b>
