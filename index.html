<h1>Professional Experience and Education</h1>
<p>
After receiving a Ph.D. in Physical Chemistry from the University of Connecticut, I performed postdoctoral work at 
Cornell University with Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Roald Hoffmann. 
Subsequently, I joined the faculty of the Chemistry Department of the University of Connecticut, where I became a tenured full professor.  
During my sabbatical year, I was a Professor at the Universit&eacute; Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France. 
</p>
<p>
I later moved from the University of Connecticut to a position as a Research Staff Member at
the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York and worked at the intersection of High Performance Computing
and Computational Chemistry, participating in workshops on High Performance Computing in the United States, Europe, and Asia.  
</p>
<p>
While at IBM, I also taught at Columbia University as an Adjunct Professor in the Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering.  
During this time, I developed several new courses for undergraduate and graduate students with a focus on Computational Chemistry and also
taught younger students in the High School Honors Program and Edison Project.   
</p>
<p>
Subsequent to leaving IBM, I was appointed Professor of Chemistry at the City University of New York - York College, and served as Director of the 
collaboration between CUNY and the U.S. FDA.
</p>
<p>
Currently, I hold a position as Research Professor - Department of Chemistry at the University of Connecticut, 
</p>
<p>
I served as Chair of the Computers in Chemistry Division of the American Chemical Society, Chair of the Peer Review Panel 
for the Large Computational Science Research Program at the Department of Energy, and more recently, as a member on the 
PetaApps Review Panel for the National Science Foundation.
<br>
<br>
Previously, I have held postions as Senior Scientist - Division of High Performance and 
Research Computing, Adjunct Faculty Member - Department of Physiology and Pharmacology at 
the Newark Campus of the Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, and Affiliate Faculty Member of the University of Alaska - Fairbanks,
College of Natural Science and Mathematics, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.
</p>
<p>
My focus has always revolved on exploiting advanced computational resources to solve demanding problems in science and medicine. I collaborate closely 
with students, postdoctorals, and faculty to apply High Performance Computing in many areas of Chemistry and 
Biochemistry. My primary research area is Computational Chemistry and have published more than sixty-five scientific papers.
